    "üÜì Exercise: Finding the Optimal Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this exercise is to find the optimal policy that given the maximum reward given an environment. For this, we will be using a pre-defined environment by OpenAI Gym. We will be using an environment called FrozenLake-v0.There are many environments defined by OpenAI Gym, that you can see here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Environment Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "Winter is here. You and your friends were tossing around a frisbee at the park when you made a wild throw that left the frisbee out in the middle of the lake. The water is mostly frozen, but there are a few holes where the ice has melted. If you step into one of those holes, you'll fall into the freezing water. At this time, there's an international frisbee shortage, so it's absolutely imperative that you navigate across the lake and retrieve the disc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent controls the movement of a character in a grid world. Some tiles of the grid are walkable, and others lead to the agent falling into the water. Additionally, the movement direction of the agent is uncertain and only partially depends on the chosen direction. The agent is rewarded for finding a walkable path to a goal tile.\n",
    "\n",
    "The surface is described using a grid-like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../fig/fig.png\" style=\"width: 500px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible actions are Left(0), Right(1), Down(2), Up(3).\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE - Here we are slightly altering the value iteration algorithm. Instead of computing the optimal value function first, we compute the optimal policy and then find the value function associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "- Initialize an environment using a pre-defined environment from OpenAI Gym.\n",
    "- Set parameters `gamma` and `theta`.\n",
    "- Define a function `policy_improvement` that returns the action which takes us to a higher valued state. This function updates the policy to the optimal policy.\n",
    "- Define a function `policy_evaluation` that updates the state value of the environment given a policy.\n",
    "- Define a function `value_iteration` that calls the above-defined functions to get an optimal policy, action sequence governed by the policy and the state value function.\n",
    "- Now test the policy by checking how many episodes (with a fixed number of steps) in the 100 episode loop does the agent reach the final goal.\n",
    "    - First, try the environment with a random policy, by taking random actions at each state.\n",
    "    - Next, take actions based on the optimal policy.\n",

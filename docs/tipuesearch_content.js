        "text": "General Does the individual HW mean I have to submit on my own but can I still work with my HW partner? An individual CS109B HW means you are supposed to work on your own, without any human intervention, assistance, or input. You are not allowed to work with partner. You are allowed to use OHs to ask for clarification questions, but we may not be able to answer all of your questions or help with your coding. You are allowed to use all of your materials from the course up to the HW, look at problem resolution online, and look at libraries documentation. Do I have access to the video recorded materials if I am not an Extension School student? Yes. All CS109B students have access to all video captured materials. If you have any issues accessing the video content, please send an email to our helpline with your name and HUID. Where should I send my questions? Use Ed for anying related to the course content or assignments. All other concerns should be sent to the course helpline: cs109b2021@gmail.com Auditing Can I audit this course? What are the rules for auditing? Yes, you are welcome to audit this course. Send an email to cs109b2021@gmail.com to request full Canvas access. All auditors must agree to abide by the following rules: All auditors are held to the same standard of academic honesty as our registered students. Please do not share homeworks or solutions with anyone. Violations will be reported to the Harvard Administrative Board. Auditors are not permitted to take the course for credit in the future. Auditors may not attend lectures or section during the live stream. Students are randomly assigned to small groups for coding exercises and mixing auditors and students in this way is not ideal. We are investigating methods that would allow auditors to join, but this is the current policy. Audiors should not submit HWs or participate in projects. Auditors should refrain from using any course and TF resources that are designed for our registered students like Ed, Jupyter Hub, and office hours. Auditors must have an active HUID number. Quizzes & Exercises When are quizzes and exercises due? Quizzes and exercises are due before the next lecture. I missed a quiz/exercise. Can I make it up? No. We will drop your lowest 25% of quizzes and your lowest 25% of exercises. This policy is to reduce stress and is in place so that missing a quiz or exercise on occasion should not affect your final grade.",

Building upon the material in Introduction to Data Science, the course introduces advanced methods for data wrangling, data visualization, statistical modeling, and prediction. Topics include big data, multiple deep learning architectures such as CNNs, RNNs, language models, transformers, autoencoders, and generative models as well as basic Bayesian methods, nonlinear statistical models, and unsupervised learning. The programming language will be Python. Tentative Course Topics Smoothing and Additive Models Unsupervised Learning, Clustering Bayesian Modeling Convolutional Neural Networks Autoencoders Recurrent Neural Networks NLP / Text Analysis Transformers Variational AutoEncoders & Generative Models Generative Adversarial Networks (Deep) Reinforcement Learning Course Objectives Upon successful completion of this course, you should feel comfortable with the material mentioned above, and you will have gained experience working with others on real-world problems. The content knowledge, the project, and teamwork will prepare you for the professional world or further studies. Course Components Lectures, sections, and advanced sections will be live-streamed and can be accessed through the Zoom section on Canvas. Video recordings of the live stream will be made available within 24 hours after the event, and will be accessible from the Lecture Video section on Canvas. Lectures The class meets, virtually, three days a week for lectures (M, W, F). Mondays and Wednesdays will be mostly lecture content with some hands-on coding, whereas Fridays will be the inverse (mostly hands-on coding). Attending and participating in lectures is a crucial component of learning the material presented in this course. What to expect A lecture will have the following pedagogy layout which will be repeated: Asynchronous pre-class exercises of approxmately 30 min. This will include, reading from the textbooks or other sources, watching videos to prepare you for the class. Approx. 10 minutes of Q&A regarding the pre-class exercises and/or review of homework and quiz questions. Live online instruction followed by a short Q/A session Hands-on exercises, on the ED platform. Sessions will help students develop the intuition for the core concepts, provide the necessary mathematical background, and provide guidance on technical details. Sessions will be accompanied by relevant examples to clarify key concepts and techniques. Quizzes At the end of each lecture, there will be a short, graded quiz that will cover the pre-class and in-class material; there will be no AC209b content in the quizzes. The quizzes will be available until the next lecture. 25% of the quizzes will be dropped from your grade. Exercises Lectures will include one or more coding exercises focused on the newly introduced material; there will be no AC209b content in the exercises. The exercises are short enough to be completed during the time allotted in lecture but they will remain available until the beginning of the following lecture to accomodate those who cannot attend in real time. 25% of the exercises will be dropped from your grade. Exercises will only be factored into your grade if the would improve your final grade. Sections Lectures are supplemented by sections led by teaching fellows. There are two types of sections: Standard Sections : This will be a mix of review of material and practice problems similar to the HW. Advanced Sections The course will include advanced sections for 209b students and will cover a different topic per week. These are 75 min lectures and they will cover advanced topics like the mathematical underpinnings of the methods seen in lecture and lab and extensions of those methods. The material covered in the advanced sections is required for all AC209b students. Tentative topics are: Segmentation Techniques, YOLO, Unet and M-RCNN RNN, Echo State Transformers / NLP Neural Network Inference GANS, Cycle GANS, etc. Deep Reinforcement Learning Note: Sections are not held every week. Consult the course calendar for exact dates. Exams There are no exams in this course. Projects During the final four (4) weeks of the course, students will be divided in break-out thematic sections where they will study topics. These topics are tentative at the moment but may include medicine, law, astronomy, e-commerce, and government. Each section will include lectures by Harvard faculty, experts on the field, followed by project work also led by that faculty. You will get to present your projects in the SEAS Design Fair at the end of the semester. Homework Assignments There will be eight graded homework assignments. Some of them will be due one week after being assigned and some will be due two weeks after being assigned. For six assignments, you have the option to work and submit in pairs, the two remaining are to be completed individually. Course Resources Online Materials All course materials, including lecture notes, lab notes, and section notes will be published on the course GitHub repo as well as the public site's Materials section . Note: Lecture content for weeks 1-3 is only available to registered students through the Materals section. Assignments will only be posted on Canvas. Working Environment You will be working in Jupyter Notebooks which you can run in your own machine or in the SEAS JupyterHub. Recommended Textbooks ISLR: An Introduction to Statistical Learning by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani (Springer: New York, 2013) DL: Deep Learning by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville. (The MIT Press: Cambridge, 2016) Glassner: Deep Learning, Vol. 1 & 2 by Andrew Glassner SLP Speech and Language Processing by Jurafsky and Martin (3rd Edition Draft) INLP Introduction to Natural Language Processing by Jacob Eisenstein (The MIT Press: Cambridge, 2019) Free electronic versions are available ( ISLR , DL , SLP , INLP ) or hard copy through Amazon ( ISLR , DL , Glassner , SLP , INLP ). Getting Help For questions about homework, course content, package installation, the process is: try to troubleshoot yourself by reading the lecture, lab, and section notes, and looking up online resources. go to office hours this is the best way to get help. post on the class Ed forum; we want you and your peers to engage in helping each other. TFs also monitor Ed and will respond within 24 hours. Note that Ed questions are visible to everyone. If you are citing homework solution code you must post privately so that only the staff sees your message. watch for official announcements via Canvas so make sure you have your Canvas notifications turned on. Ed should always be your first resource for seeking answers to your content questions. send an email to the Helpline cs109b2020@gmail.com for administrative issues, regrade requests, and non-content specific questions. for personal matters that you do not feel comfortable sharing with the TFs, you may send an email to either or both of the instructors. Course Policies and Expectations Grading for CS109b, STAT121b, and CS209b (tentative): Your final score for the course will be computed using the following weights: Assignment Final Grade Weight Paired Homework (6) 47% Individual Homework (2) 21% Quizzes 8% Ed Exercises 4% Project 20% Total 100% Note: Regular homework (for everyone) counts as 5 points. 209b extra homework counts as 1 point. Collaboration Policy We expect you to adhere to the Harvard Honor Code at all times. Failure to adhere to the honor code and our policies may result in serious penalties, up to and including automatic failure in the course and reference to the ad board. If you work with a partner on an assignment make sure both parties solve all the problems. Do not divide and conquer. You are expected to be intellectually honest and give credit where credit is due. In particular: if you work with a fellow student but decide to submit different papers, include the name of each other in the designated area of the submission paper. if you work with a fellow student and want to submit the same paper you need to form a group prior to the submission. Details in the assignment. Not all assignments will permit group submissions. you need to write your solutions entirely on your own or with your collaborator you are welcome to take ideas from code presented in labs, lecture, or sections but you need to change it, adapt it to your style, and ultimately write your own. We do not want to see code copied verbatim from the above sources. if you use code found on the internet, books, or other sources you need to cite those sources. you should not view any written materials or code created by other students for the same assignment; you may not provide or make available solutions to individuals who take or may take this course in the future. if the assignment allows it you may use third-party libraries and example code, so long as the material is available to all students in the class and you give proper attribution. Do not remove any original copyright notices and headers. Late or Wrongly Submitted Assignments There are no late days in homework submission. We will accept late submissions only for medical reasons and if accompanied by a doctor's note. To submit after Canvas has closed or to ask for an extension , send an email to the Helpline with subject line \"Submit HW1: Reason=the flu\" replacing 'HW1' with the name of the current assignment and \"the flu\" with your reason. You need to attach the note from your medical provider otherwise we will not accept the request. If you forgot to join a Group with your peer and are asking for the same grade we will accept this with no penalty up to HW3. For homeworks beyond that we feel that you should be familiar with the process of joining groups. After that there will be a penalty of -1 point for both members of the group provided the submission was on time. Re-grade Requests Our graders and instructors make every effort in grading accurately and in giving you a lot of feedback. If you discover that your answer to a homework problem was correct but it was marked as incorrect, send an email to the Helpline with a description of the error. Please do not submit regrade requests based on what you perceive is overly harsh grading . The points we take off are based on a grading rubric that is being applied uniformly to all assignments. If you decide to send a regrade request , send an email to the Helpline with subject line \"Regrade HW1: Grader=johnsmith\" replacing 'HW1' with the current assignment and 'johnsmith' with the name of the grader within 48 hours of the grade release. Auditing the Class You are welcome to audit this course. To request access, send an email to cs109b2021@gmail.com with you HUID (required) and a statment of agreement to the terms below. All auditors must agree to abide by the following rules: All auditors are held to the same standard of academic honesty as our registered students. Please do not share homeworks or solutions with anyone. Violations will be reported to the Harvard Administrative Board. Auditors are not permitted to take the course for credit in the future. Auditors may not attend lectures or section during the live stream. Students are randomly assigned to small groups for coding exercises and mixing auditors and students in this way is not ideal. We are investigating methods that would allow auditors to join, but this is the current policy. Audiors should not submit HWs or participate in projects. Auditors should refrain from using any course and TF resources that are designed for our registered students like Ed, Jupyter Hub, and office hours. Academic Integrity Ethical behavior is an important trait of a Data Scientist, from ethically handling data to attribution of code and work of others. Thus, in CS109b we give a strong emphasis to Academic Honesty. As a student your best guidelines are to be reasonable and fair. We encourage teamwork for problem sets, but you should not split the homework and you should work on all the problems together. For more detailed expectations, please refer to the Collaborations section above. You are responsible for understanding Harvard Extension School policies on academic integrity https://www.extension.harvard.edu/resources-policies/student-conduct/academic-integrity and how to use sources responsibly. Stated most broadly, academic integrity means that all course work submitted, whether a draft or a final version of a paper, project, take-home exam, online exam, computer program, oral presentation, or lab report, must be your own words and ideas, or the sources must be clearly acknowledged. The potential outcomes for violations of academic integrity are serious and ordinarily include all of the following: required withdrawal (RQ), which means a failing grade in the course (with no refund), the suspension of registration privileges, and a notation on your transcript. Using sources responsibly https://www.extension.harvard.edu/resources-policies/resources/avoiding-plagiarism is an essential part of your Harvard education. We provide additional information about our expectations regarding academic integrity on our website. We invite you to review that information and to check your understanding of academic citation rules by completing two free online 15-minute tutorials that are also available on our site. (The tutorials are anonymous open-learning tools.) Accommodations for students with disabilities Harvard students needing academic adjustments or accommodations because of a documented disability must present their Faculty Letter from the Accessible Education Office (AEO) and speak with the professor by the end of the second week of the term, (fill in specific date). Failure to do so may result in the Course Head's inability to respond in a timely manner. All discussions will remain confidential, although Faculty are invited to contact AEO to discuss appropriate implementation. Harvard Extension School is committed to providing an inclusive, accessible academic community for students with disabilities and chronic health conditions. The Accessibility Services Office (ASO) https://www.extension.harvard.edu/resources-policies/accessibility-services-office-aso offers accommodations and supports to students with documented disabilities. If you have a need for accommodations or adjustments in your course, please contact the Accessibility Services Office by email at accessibility@extension.harvard.edu or by phone at 617-998-9640. Diversity and Inclusion Statement Data Science and Computer Science have historically been representative of only a small sliver of the population. This is despite the contributions of a diverse group of early pioneers - see Ada Lovelace, Dorothy Vaughan, and Grace Hopper for just a few examples. As educators, we aim to build a diverse, inclusive, and representative community offering opportunities in data science to those who have been historically marginalized. We will encourage learning that advances ethical data science, exposes bias in the way data science is used, and advances research into fair and responsible data science. We need your help to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and experiences, and honors your identities (including but not limited to race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this: If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those in your official Harvard records, please let us know! If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please do not hesitate to come and talk with us. We want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback (which will lead to us making a general announcement to the class, if necessary, to address your concerns). If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, you may find helpful resources at the Harvard Office of Diversity and Inclusion. We (like many people) are still learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to us about it. As a participant in course discussions, you are expected to respect your classmates' diverse backgrounds and perspectives. Our course will discuss diversity, inclusion, and ethics in data science. Please contact us (in person or electronically) or submit anonymous feedback if you have any suggestions for how we can improve.",

Here, you'll gain practice working with actual words, as you'll parse, count, and calculate a probability. An individual unigram's likelihood ( unsmoothed ) is defined as: $$L\\left(w\\right)=\\frac{n_w\\left(D_t\\right)}{n_o\\left(D_t\\right)}$$ where the numerator represents the number of times word $w$ appeared in the training corpus $D_t$. For this exercise, we will define the smoothed unigram's likelihood as: $$L\\left(w\\right)=\\frac{n_w\\left(D_t\\right)\\ +\\alpha}{n_o\\left(D_t\\right)\\ +\\alpha\\left|V\\right|}$$ where $\\alpha$ is a specified real-valued number (doesn't have to be an integer), and $|V|$ is the cardinality of the lexicon (i.e., the number of distinct word types in the vocabulary) The likelihood of a new sequence $H$ is simply defined by the likelihood of each token, multiplied by each other: $$L\\left(H\\right)=\\prod_{w\\ \\in H}&#94;{ }L\\left(w\\right)$$ HINTS : Depending on your approach, these functions could help you: re.sub() (regular expression) .split() .lower() .strip() .replace() .sum() defaultdict data structure Counter data structure **REMINDER** : After running every cell, be sure to auto-grade your work by clicking 'Mark' in the lower-right corner.

It should return this text as a list of tokens. Specifically, the tokens should: be lowercased be separated by whitespace and any character present in the list of punctuation . include no trailing or preceeding whitespace (none of the returned tokens should be of white space or empty) For example, if the input is \" I LOVE daTa!!\" , it should return [\"i\", love\", \"data\", \"!\", \"!\"] In [3]: ### edTest(test_a) ### def parse_string ( text ): # YOUR CODE STARTS HERE # YOUR CODE ENDS HERE return text # DO NOT EDIT THE LINES BELOW text = open ( training_file ) . read () tokens = parse_string ( text ) Write a function count_tokens() that takes a list of tokens and simply outputs a dictionary-style count of the items.

        "text": "Title : RNN from scratch Description : The aim of this exercise is to understand what happens within an RNN unit that is wrapped within the tensorflow.keras.layers.SimpleRNN The idea is to write a Recurrent Neural Network from scratch that generates names of dinosaurs by training on the existing names character-wise. Instructions: Read the file dino.txt and convert all the names in the files to lowercase. Save the names in the file as a list. Get the number of words in the file and the vocabulary size which is equal to the number of alphabets plus the newline character. Define a dictionary char_to_ix where the key is the sorted vocabulary and the value is the integer value assigned to it. Define a dictionary ix_to_char where the key is the integer value assigned to the unique vocabulary and the value is the sorted vocabulary. To get the model parameters (weights and biases) call the get_weights function twice once by: Setting the random parameter as 1 to get random weights Setting the random parameter as 0 to get the trained weights by specifying the number of iterations. Define a function rnn_model that takes in the network parameters and outputs the generated dinosaur name based on the instructions in the scaffold.

A. The length of the names generated increases proportionately with the number of iterations. B. Insufficient storage because of large window size. C. The names generated are better due to longer training. D. Larger number of iterations causes the loss of the model to increase.

In order to do this exercise, we will use the IMDB movie review dataset to perform sentiment analysis. Your final comparison for the trace plot may look something like this: Instructions: Read the IMDB dataset from the helper code given. Take a quick look at your training inputs and labels. Pad the values to a fix number max_words in-order to have sequences of the same size. First post pad the inputs with padding='post' i.e sequences smaller than max_words will be followed by zero padding. Build, compile and fit a Vanilla RNN and evaluate it on the test set. Now refit the model, but this time post pad the inputs with padding='pre' Again evaluate the model performance on the test set. Finally, rebuild a model with the Gated Recurrent Unit and fit and evaluate on the training and test set respectively. Compare the performance of all three models similar to the table above.

We will limit the maximum review length to max_words by truncating longer reviews and padding shorter reviews. We can accomplish this using the pad_sequences() function in tensorflow.keras . For now, set max_words to 500. ⏸ If we use post-padding on a sequence, the new sequence is\" A. \"Padded with zeros before the start of original sequence\" B. \"Padded with zeros after the end of the original sequence\" C. \"Padded with ones before the start of original sequence\" D. \"Padded with ones after the end of the original sequence\" In [8]: ### edTest(test_chow2) ### # Submit an answer choice as a string below (eg. if you choose option C, put 'C') answer2 = '___' In [9]: # We will clip large reviews and pad smaller reviews to 500 words max_words = 500 # We can pad the smaller sequences with 0s before, or after. # This choice can severely affect network performance # In the first case we, will pad after the sequence # Please utilize sequence.pad_sequences() postpad_X_train = ___ postpad_X_test = ___ RNN model for sentiment analysis We build the model architecture in the code cell below. We have imported some layers from tensorflow.keras that you might need but feel free to use any other layers / transformations you like.

The short review network negligibly trains, whereas the longer review model trains very well. To counter this, we will now pre-pad the shorter sequences. In [15]: # We can pre-pad by using `sequence.pad_sequences` with `padding='pre'` max_words = 500 prepad_X_train = ___ prepad_X_test = ___ Trace Plot - Take 2 Again, we investigate the trace plots for the two categories, but this time, with pre-padding In [16]: # Reinitializing the models for the two categories model_short = model_maker ( summary = False ) model_long = model_maker ( summary = False ) In [17]: # Again we train `model_short` with short reviews X_short = ___ y_short = ___ epochs = 10 history_short = model_short . fit ( ___ , ___ , epochs = epochs , batch_size = 640 , verbose = 0 ); In [18]: # Then we train `model_long` with short reviews X_long = ___ y_long = ___ history_long = model_long . fit ( ___ , ___ , epochs = epochs , batch_size = 640 , verbose = 0 ); In [19]: # Helper function to plot the data # Plot the MSE of the model plt . rcParams [ \"figure.figsize\" ] = ( 8 , 6 ) plt . title ( \"Padding='pre'\" , fontsize = 20 ) plt . semilogy ( history_short . history [ 'loss' ], label = 'Shorter reviews' , color = '#FF9A98' , linewidth = 3 ) plt . semilogy ( history_long . history [ 'loss' ], label = 'Longer reviews' , color = '#75B594' , linewidth = 3 ) plt . legend () # Set the axes labels plt . xlabel ( 'Epochs' , fontsize = 14 ) plt . xticks ( range ( 1 , epochs , 4 )) plt . ylabel ( 'MSE Loss' , fontsize = 14 ) plt . legend ( fontsize = 14 ) plt . show () 🍲 Further improvements We solved the vanishing gradient problem by pre-padding the sequences, but what other design choices can help you improve performance?

Occlusion involves running a patch over the entire image to see which pixels affect the classification the most. Instructions: Define a convolutional neural network based on the architecture mentioned in the scaffold. Load the trained model weights given in the occlusion_model_weights.h5 file. Take a quick look at the model architecture using model.summary() . Use the helper function occlusion to visualize the delta loss as a mask moves across the image. The output will look similar to the one shown below. Hints: MaxPooling2D() Max pooling operation for 2D spatial data. compile() Configures the model for training. Conv2D() 2D convolution layer (e.g. spatial convolution over images). flatten() Flattens the input. Dense() A regular densely-connected NN layer.

Table of Contents Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Simulations in PyMC3 . Hierarchical models . Top 1. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Simulations PyMC3 is a Python library for programming Bayesian analysis, and more specifically, data creation, model definition, model fitting, and posterior analysis. It uses the concept of a model which contains assigned parametric statistical distributions to unknown quantities in the model. Within models we define random variables and their distributions. A distribution requires at least a name argument, and other parameters that define it. You may also use the logp() method in the model to build the model log-likelihood function. We define and fit the model. PyMC3 includes a comprehensive set of pre-defined statistical distributions that can be used as model building blocks. Although they are not meant to be used outside of a model , you can invoke them by using the prefix pm , as in pm.Normal . Monte Carlo methods are rooted in the 1940s when Enrico Fermi, John von Neumann, Stan Ulam, Nicolas Metropolis, and others, employed the use of random numbers to study physics from a stochastic point of view. The name is attributed to Metropolis 1 . For a history of the Monte Carlo Method first used in Physics see: The beginning of the Monte Carlo Method PyMC3 uses the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) and the Random Walk Metropolis , two Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for sampling in posterior space. Monte Carlo gets its name because when we sample in posterior space, we choose our next move via a pseudo-random process. NUTS is a sophisticated algorithm that can handle a large number of unknown (albeit continuous) variables.

's famous radon dataset is a classic for hierarchical modeling. In this dataset the amount of the radioactive gas radon has been measured among different households in counties in several states. Radon gas is known to be the highest cause of lung cancer in non-smokers. It is believed to be more strongly present in households containing a basement and to differ in amount present among types of soil. Here we'll investigate this differences and try to make predictions of radonlevels in different county's based on the county itself and the presence of a basement. We'll look at Minnesota, a state that contains 85 counties in which different measurements are taken, ranging from 2 to 116 measurements.

Specifically, we may assume that while $\\alpha_c$ and $\\beta_c$are different for each county as in the unpooled case, the coefficients are all drawn from the same distribution: \\begin{equation} radon_{i,c} = \\alpha_c + \\beta_c*floor_{i,c} \\end{equation} \\begin{equation} a_c \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_a,\\,\\sigma_a&#94;{2}) \\end{equation} \\begin{equation} b_c \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_b,\\,\\sigma_b&#94;{2}) \\end{equation} where the common parameters are: \\begin{eqnarray} \\mu_a \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\,10) \\\\ \\sigma_a&#94;2 \\sim |\\mathcal{N}(0,\\,10)| \\\\ \\mu_b \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\,10) \\\\ \\sigma_b&#94;2 \\sim |\\mathcal{N}(0,\\,10)| \\end{eqnarray} The different counties are effectively sharing information through the common priors. We are thus observing what is known as shrinkage; modeling the groups not as independent from each other, neither as a single group but rather as related. Discussion: how can we best handle this data? Does it make sense to make inferences without taking into account the county? TALKING POINTS We saw that some counties had only one sample, so if that house is a really old with old lead pipes, our prediction will be that all houses in this county have radon. On the other extreme, if we have a newer house with no radon then again we will have missleading results. In one case, you will overestimate the bad quality and in the other underestimate it. Under a hierarchical model, the miss-estimation of one group will be offset by the information provided by the other groups. As always, gathering more data helps, if this is an option.

Can we find out if this a fair coin without using sampling? Let's say you visit the casino. You want to test your theory that casinos are dubious places where coins have been manipulated to have a larger probability for tails. So you will try to estimate how fair a coin is based on a certain amount of flips. You have no prior opinion on the coin's fairness (i.e. what $\\theta$ might be ), and begin flipping the coin. You get either Heads ($H$) or Tails ($T$) as our observed data and want to see if your posterior probabilities change as you obtain more data, that is, more coin flips. A nice way to visualize this is to plot the posterior probabilities as we observe more data. Your data is the pair ($n,k$) where $n$ is the number of flips and $k$ is the number of successes. We will be using Bayes rule. $\\textbf{D}$ is our data. Posterior $\\propto$ Prior $\\times$ Likelihood \\begin{equation} P(\\theta|\\textbf{D}) \\propto P(\\theta) \\times P(\\textbf{D} |\\theta) \\end{equation} a) Let's say we believe that our experiment is governed by a $\\text{Binomial}$ distribution (this will be our Likelihood). \\begin{equation} P(\\theta|\\textbf{D}) \\propto \\text{Beta(a,b)} \\times \\text{Binomial}(\\textbf{k},\\textbf{n}|\\theta) \\end{equation} b) We start with a non-informative prior, a $\\text{Beta}$ distribution with (a=b=1.) \\begin{equation} P(\\theta|1.,1.) = \\text{Beta(1., 1.)} \\end{equation} c) We enter the data as pairs of ($\\textbf{k},\\textbf{n}$) (we observe $\\textbf{k}$ heads in $\\textbf{n}$ tosses), and we update our Beta with new a,b as follows $&#94;*$: \\begin{equation} P(\\theta|\\textbf{k}) = Beta(\\alpha + \\textbf{k}, \\beta + (n - \\textbf{k})) \\end{equation} d) We are done! That is why using a congugate prior helps you find your parameters analytically. $&#94;*$ (the proof for this formula is beyond our scope, if interested, see this Wikipedia article ) In [47]: # change the data trials = np . array ([ 0 , 1 , 3 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 500 , 200 , 400 ]) heads = np . array ( [ 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 10 , 10 , 250 , 180 , 10 ]) # non-informative prior Beta(a,b=1), shows our ignorance about the coin # informative prior Beta(a,b=10.), shows our belief that this is a fair coin # informative prior Beta(a=20.,b=2.), shows our belief that this is NOT a fair coin alphas = [ 1. , 10. , 20. ] betas = [ 1. , 10. , 2. ] colors = [ '#348ABD' , '#000BCC' , '#999BCC' ] opacity = [ 0.4 , 0.2 , 0.1 ] plt . figure ( figsize = ( 10 , 12 )) x = np . linspace ( 0 , 1 , 100 ) for k , N in enumerate ( trials ): sublabel = f 'n trials = { trials [ k ] } , k = { heads [ k ] } ' sx = plt . subplot ( len ( trials ) / 2 , 2 , k + 1 ) for i in range ( len ( alphas )): posterior = stats . beta . pdf ( x , alphas [ i ] + heads [ k ], betas [ i ] + trials [ k ] - heads [ k ]) plt . plot ( x , posterior , alpha = 0.5 , c = colors [ i ], label = f 'a= { alphas [ i ] } ,b= { betas [ i ] } ' ); plt . fill_between ( x , 0 , posterior , color = colors [ i ], alpha = opacity [ i ]) plt . legend ( loc = 'upper left' , fontsize = 10 ) plt . title ( sublabel ) plt . legend () plt . autoscale ( tight = True ) plt . suptitle ( \"Posterior probabilities for coin flips\" , fontsize = 15 ); plt . tight_layout () plt . subplots_adjust ( top = 0.88 ) Appendix B: MAP Fitting the Model with MAP (FYI, we will not directly use this method) In Bayesian analysis we have our prior(s) , we define our likelihood , and, having specified our model , we try to calculate posterior estimates for the unknown variables in the model. We could try to calculate the posterior estimates analytically, but for most the models, this is not feasible. What we do then is compute summaries based on samples drawn from the posterior distribution using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods. \\begin{equation} P(\\theta|\\textbf{D}) \\rightarrow \\{\\theta_1,....\\theta_n\\} \\end{equation} Then we can find any estimate we want by using these samples, for example: \\begin{equation} \\mathbb{E}[f(\\theta] = \\int d\\theta{p(\\theta) f(\\theta)} \\end{equation} So we calculate the maximum a posteriori (MAP) point using optimization methods. \\begin{equation} f(\\hat{\\theta}), \\hat{\\theta} = argmax ({p(\\theta))} \\end{equation} The maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate for a model, is the mode of the posterior distribution and is generally found using numerical optimization methods. This is often fast and easy to do, but only gives a point estimate for the parameters and can be biased if the mode isn't representative of the distribution. PyMC3 provides this functionality with the find_MAP function. MAP estimate is not always reasonable, especially if the mode is at an extreme or we have a multimodal distribution, or we have high dimensional posteriors. This will often occur in hierarchical models with the variance parameter for the random effect. If the individual group means are all the same, the posterior will have near infinite density if the variance parameter for the group means is almost zero. Most techniques for finding the MAP estimate only find a local optimium (which is often good enough), and can therefore fail badly for multimodal posteriors, as mentioned above. To solve these issues we turn to sampling as our method for finding the posterior. You do not have to worry about MAP in our problems. Our pyMC3 models use the MAP method to initialize the variables under the hood and we do not have to explicitly set this. References : Salvatier J, Wiecki TV, Fonnesbeck C. 2016.

        "text": "Title : Feed-Forward Neural Networks vs Convolution Neural Networks Description : The aim of this exercise is to train a feed-forward neural network and a convolutional neural network and compare the number of parameters between them on the following image classification task Instructions: Since we have only one 'Pavlos' and one 'Not Pavlos' image, we will need to augment our dataset. We use an image generator to create 'translated' versions of our two images. The training is performed on these translated images given in the data folder. Feed-Forward Neural Network: Build a simple Feed-Forward Neural Network and compile the model with binary cross entropy as the loss. Fit the model on the training data and save the history. Predict on the entire data. Visualize the loss and accuracy on train and validation data with respect to the epochs. Convolutional Neural Network: Build a Convolution Neural Networks and compile the model with binary cross-entropy as the loss. Fit the model on the training data and save the history. Predict on the entire data. Visualize the loss and accuracy on train and validation data with respect to the epochs. Compare the accuracy and the number of parameters of both the models. Hints: keras.Sequential() Creates a sequential model. A Sequential model is appropriate for a plain stack of layers where each layer has exactly one input tensor and one output tensor. keras.compile() Configures the model for training. keras.fit() Trains the model for a fixed number of epochs. history.history[] The returned \"history\" object from model.fit() holds a dictionary of the loss values and metric values during training. keras.evaluate() Returns the loss value & metrics values for the model in test mode. tf.keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator() Generate batches of tensor image data with real-time data augmentation. This function is used in our helper code. tf.keras.layers.Flatten() Flattens the input. Does not affect the batch size. tf.keras.layers.Conv2D() 2D convolution layer (e.g. spatial convolution over images). tf.keras.layers.Dense() A regular densely-connected NN layer. NOTE - The accuracy testing is done on the original network. Ensure to reset to the original parameters after answering the pause and think questions to pass the tests.

Table of Contents Some common families of distributions (review) The Bayesian Way of Thinking Bayesian Regression with pyMC3 and Defining a model in pyMC3 Bayesian Logistic Regression with pyMC3 Appendix 1. Some common families of distributions Statistical distributions are characterized by one of more parameters, such as $\\mu$ and $\\sigma&#94;2$ for a Gaussian distribution. \\begin{equation} Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\,\\sigma&#94;{2}) \\end{equation} Discrete Distributions The probability mass function (pmf) of a discrete random variable $Y$ is equal to the probability that our random variable will take a specific value $y$: $f_y=P(Y=y)$ for all $y$. The variable, most of the times, assumes integer values. Plots for pmf s are better understood as stem plots since we have discrete values for the probabilities and not a curve. Probabilities should add up to 1 for proper distributions. Bernoulli for a binary outcome, success has probability $\\theta$, and we only have $one$ trial: \\begin{equation} P(Y=k) = \\theta&#94;k(1-\\theta)&#94;{1-k} \\end{equation} Binomial for a binary outcome, success has probability $\\theta$, $k$ successes in $n$ trials: Our random variable is $Y$= number of successes in $n$ trials. \\begin{equation} P(Y=k|n,\\theta) = {{n}\\choose{k}} \\cdot \\theta&#94;k(1-\\theta)&#94;{n-k} \\quad k=0,1,2,...,n \\end{equation} As a reminder ${{n}\\choose{k}}$ is \"from $n$ choose $k$\": \\begin{equation} {{n}\\choose{k}} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\end{equation} $EY=n\\theta$, $VarY = np(1-p)$ Note : Binomial (1,$p$) = Bernouli ($p$) Exercise : Run the code below (that plots the Binomial distribution using stats.binom.pmf ) for various values of the probability for a success $\\theta\\in [0,1]$. Look at the ordinate values to verify that they add up to 1.

Remember that the y-axis in a discrete probability distribution shows the probability of the random variable having a specific value in the x-axis. We use stats.poisson.pmf(x, $\\lambda$) , where $\\lambda$ is the parameter.

Remember that the y-axis in a continuous probability distribution does not shows the actual probability of the random variable having a specific value in the x-axis because that probability is zero!. Instead, to see the probability that the variable is within a small margin we look at the integral below the curve of the PDF. The uniform is often used as a noninformative prior. Uniform - numpy.random.uniform(a=0.0, b=1.0, size) $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are our parameters. size is how many tries to perform.

Note that Beta is a good distribution to use for priors (beliefs) because its range is $[0,1]$ which is the natural range for a probability and because we can model a wide range of functions by changing the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ parameters. Its density (pdf) is: \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:beta} P(\\theta|a,b) = \\frac{1}{B(\\alpha, \\beta)} {\\theta}&#94;{\\alpha - 1} (1 - \\theta)&#94;{\\beta - 1} \\propto {\\theta}&#94;{\\alpha - 1} (1 - \\theta)&#94;{\\beta - 1} \\end{equation} where the normalisation constant, $B$, is a beta function of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, \\begin{equation} B(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\int_{x=0}&#94;1 x&#94;{\\alpha - 1} (1 - x)&#94;{\\beta - 1} dx. \\end{equation} 'Nice', unimodal distribution Range of values $[0, 1]$ $EX = \\frac{a}{a+b}$, $VarX = \\frac{ab}{(a+b)&#94;2(a+b+1)}$ Exercise : Try out various combinations of $a$ and $b$. We get an amazing set of shapes by tweaking the two parameters $a$ and $b$. Notice that for $a=b=1.$ we get the uniform distribution.

The Bayesian way of Thinking Here is my state of knowledge about the situation. Here is some data, I am now going to revise my state of knowledge. Bayes Rule \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:bayes} P(A|\\textbf{B}) = \\frac{P(\\textbf{B} |A) P(A) }{P(\\textbf{B})} \\end{equation} $P(A|\\textbf{B})$ is the posterior distribution, probability(parameters| data). $P(\\textbf{B} |A)$ is the likelihood function, how probable is my data for different values of the parameters. $P(A)$ is the marginal probability to observe the data, called the prior , this captures our belief about the data before observing it. $P(\\textbf{B})$ is the marginal distribution (sometimes called marginal likelihood). This serves a normalization purpose. Let's Make a Deal The problem we are about to solve gained fame as part of a game show \"Let's Make A Deal\" hosted by Monty Hall, hence its name. It was first raised by Steve Selvin in American Statistician in 1975. The game is as follows: there are 3 doors behind one of which are the keys to a new car. There is a goat behind each of the other two doors. Let's assume your goal is to get the car and not a goat. You are asked to pick one door, and let's say you pick Door1 . The host knows where the keys are. Of the two remaining closed doors, he will always open the door that has a goat behind it. He'll say \"I will do you a favor and open Door2 \". So he opens Door2 inside which there is, of course, a goat. He now asks you, do you want to open the initial Door1 you chose or change to Door3 ? Generally, in this game, when you are presented with this choice should you swap the doors? Hint: Start by defining the events of this probabilities game. One definition is: $A_i$: car is behind door $i$ $B_i$ host opens door $i$ $i\\in[1,2,3]$ In more math terms, the question is: is the probability of the price is behind Door 1 higher than the probability of the price is behind Door2 , given that an event has occured ? Breakout Game : Solve the Monty Hall Paradox using Bayes Rule. Bayes rule revisited We have data that we believe come from an underlying distribution of unknown parameters. If we find those parameters, we know everything about the process that generated this data and we can make inferences (create new data). \\begin{equation} P(\\theta|\\textbf{D}) = \\frac{P(\\textbf{D} |\\theta) P(\\theta) }{P(\\textbf{D})} \\end{equation} But what is $\\theta \\;$? $\\theta$ is an unknown yet fixed set of parameters. In Bayesian inference we express our belief about what $\\theta$ might be and instead of trying to guess $\\theta$ exactly, we look for its probability distribution . What that means is that we are looking for the parameters of that distribution. For example, for a Poisson distribution our $\\theta$ is only $\\lambda$. In a normal distribution, our $\\theta$ is often just $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$. Top 3. Bayesian Regression with pyMC3 PyMC3 is a Python library for programming Bayesian analysis, and more specifically, data creation, model definition, model fitting, and posterior analysis. It uses the concept of a model which contains assigned parametric statistical distributions to unknown quantities in the model. Within models we define random variables and their distributions. A distribution requires at least a name argument, and other parameters that define it. You may also use the logp() method in the model to build the model log-likelihood function. We define and fit the model. PyMC3 includes a comprehensive set of pre-defined statistical distributions that can be used as model building blocks. They are not meant to be used outside of a model , and you can invoke them by using the prefix pm , as in pm.Normal . For more see: PyMC3 Quickstart Distributions in PyMC3 : Statistical Distributions in pyMC3 . Information about PyMC3 functions including descriptions of distributions, sampling methods, and other functions, is available via the help command. In [0]: #help(pm.Beta) Defining a Model in PyMC3 Our problem is the following: we want to perform multiple linear regression to predict an outcome variable $Y$ which depends on variables $\\bf{x}_1$ and $\\bf{x}_2$. We will model $Y$ as normally distributed observations with an expected value $mu$ that is a linear function of the two predictor variables, $\\bf{x}_1$ and $\\bf{x}_2$. \\begin{equation} Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\,\\sigma&#94;{2}) \\end{equation} \\begin{equation} \\mu = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\bf{x}_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 \\end{equation} where $\\sigma&#94;2$ represents the measurement error (in this example, we will use $\\sigma&#94;2 = 10$) We also choose the parameters to have normal distributions with those parameters set by us. \\begin{eqnarray} \\beta_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\,10) \\\\ \\sigma&#94;2 \\sim |\\mathcal{N}(0,\\,10)| \\end{eqnarray} We will artificially create the data to predict on. We will then see if our model predicts them correctly.

In [0]: ## do not worry if this does not work, it's just a nice graph to have ## you need to install python-graphviz first # conda install -c conda-forge python-graphviz pm . model_to_graphviz ( my_linear_model ) Now all we need to do is sample our model. ... to be continued Appendix A: Bayesian Logistic Regression with pyMC3 If the problem above was a classification that required a Logistic Regression, we would use the logistic function ( where $\\beta_0$ is the intercept, and $\\beta_i$ (i=1, 2, 3) determines the shape of the logistic function). \\begin{equation} Pr(Y=1|X_1,X_2,X3) = {\\frac{1}{1 + exp&#94;{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + \\beta_3X_3)}}} \\end{equation} Since both $\\beta_0$ and the $\\beta_i$s can be any possitive or negative number, we can model them as gaussian random variables. \\begin{eqnarray} \\beta_0 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\,\\sigma&#94;2) \\\\ \\beta_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_i,\\,\\sigma_i&#94;2) \\end{eqnarray} In PyMC3 we can model those as: pm.Normal('beta_0', mu=0, sigma=100) (where $\\mu$ and $\\sigma&#94;2$ can have some initial values that we assign them, e.g. 0 and 100) The dererministic variable would be: logitp = beta0 + beta_1 * X_1 + beta_2 * X_2 + beta_3 * X_3 To connect this variable (logit-p) with our observed data, we would use a Bernoulli as our likelihood. our_likelihood = pm.Bernoulli('our_likelihood', logit_p=logitp, observed=our_data) Notice that the main difference with Linear Regression is the use of a Bernoulli distribution instead of a Gaussian distribution, and the use of the logistic function instead of the identity function. Breakout Room Exercise : Write the model above in code. Suppose that your training dataframe (df_train) has the following features: **numerical** - df_train['age'] - df_train['weight'] **categorical** - df_train['hypertension'] In [0]: # A reminder of what the logistic function looks like. # Change parameters a and b to see the shape of the curve change b = 5. x = np . linspace ( - 8 , 8 , 100 ) plt . plot ( x , 1 / ( 1 + np . exp ( - b * x ))) plt . xlabel ( 'y' ) plt . ylabel ( 'y=logistic(x)' ) Appendix B: Is this a fair coin? Is this a fair coin? Let's say you visit the casino in Monte Carlo . You want to test your theory that casinos are dubious places where coins have been manipulated to have a larger probability for tails. So you will try to estimate how fair a coin is based on a certain amount of flips. You have no prior opinion on the coin's fairness (i.e. what $p$ might be), and begin flipping the coin. You get either Heads ($H$) or Tails ($T$) as our observed data and want to see if your posterior probabilities change as you obtain more data, that is, more coin flips. A nice way to visualize this is to plot the posterior probabilities as we observe more flips (data). We will be using Bayes rule. $\\textbf{D}$ is our data. \\begin{equation} P(\\theta|\\textbf{D}) = \\frac{P(\\textbf{D} |\\theta) P(\\theta) }{P(\\textbf{D})} \\end{equation} We start with a non-informative prior, a Beta distribution with (a=b=1.) \\begin{equation} P(\\theta|\\textbf{k=0}) = Beta(1., 1.) \\end{equation} Then, as we get new data (say, we observe $k$ heads in $n$ tosses), we update our Beta with new a,b as follows: \\begin{equation} P(\\theta|\\textbf{k}) = Beta(\\alpha + \\textbf{k}, \\beta + (n - \\textbf{k})) \\end{equation} (the proof is beyond our scope, if interested, see this Wikipedia article ) we can say that $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ play the roles of a \"prior number of heads\" and \"prior number of tails\".

As a reminder the variables we will be using today include: AHD : whether or not the patient presents atherosclerotic heart disease (a heart attack): Yes or No Sex : a binary indicator for whether the patient is male (Sex=1) or female (Sex=0) Age : age of patient, in years MaxHR : the maximum heart rate of patient based on exercise testing RestBP : the resting systolic blood pressure of the patient Chol : the HDL cholesterol level of the patient Oldpeak : ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (on an ECG) Slope : the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1 = upsloping; 2 = flat; 3 = downsloping) Ca : number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy For further information on the dataset, please see the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository .

Is an error created? Should one be? Investigate by predicting AHD from two copies of Age , and compare to the simple logistic regression model with Age alone. In [3]: y = df_heart [ 'AHD' ] logit1 = LogisticRegression ( penalty = \"none\" , solver = \"lbfgs\" ) . fit ( df_heart [[ 'Age' ]], y ) # investigating what happens when two identical predictors of 'Age' are used logit2 = LogisticRegression ( penalty = \"none\" , solver = \"lbfgs\" ) . fit ( df_heart [[ 'Age' , 'Age' ]], y ) print ( \"The coef estimate for Age (when in the model once):\" , logit1 . coef_ ) print ( \"The coef estimates for Age (when in the model twice):\" , logit2 . coef_ ) The coef estimate for Age (when in the model once): [[0.05198618]] The coef estimates for Age (when in the model twice): [[0.02599311 0.02599311]] your answer here The single coefficient for Age is distributed equally across the two predictors. This is a very reasonable approach as predictions will still be stable. We will apply PCA to the heart dataset when there are just 4 predictors considered (remember: PCA is used when dimensionality is high (lots of predictors), but this will help us get our heads around what is going on): In [4]: # For pedagogical purposes, let's simplify our lives and use just 7 predictors X = df_heart [[ 'Age' , 'RestBP' , 'Chol' , 'MaxHR' , 'Sex' , 'Oldpeak' , 'Slope' ]] y = df_heart [ 'AHD' ] X . describe () Out[4]: Age RestBP Chol MaxHR Sex Oldpeak Slope count 303.000000 303.000000 303.000000 303.000000 303.000000 303.000000 303.000000 mean 54.438944 131.689769 246.693069 149.607261 0.679868 1.039604 1.600660 std 9.038662 17.599748 51.776918 22.875003 0.467299 1.161075 0.616226 min 29.000000 94.000000 126.000000 71.000000 0.000000 0.000000 1.000000 25% 48.000000 120.000000 211.000000 133.500000 0.000000 0.000000 1.000000 50% 56.000000 130.000000 241.000000 153.000000 1.000000 0.800000 2.000000 75% 61.000000 140.000000 275.000000 166.000000 1.000000 1.600000 2.000000 max 77.000000 200.000000 564.000000 202.000000 1.000000 6.200000 3.000000 In [5]: # Here is the table of correlations between our predictors.

How do you know? How will PCA handle these correlations? Solution: Yes, there is evidence of collinearity as the estimated $\\beta$ coefficient for Age changes greatly from the simple regression model ($\\hat{\\beta} = 0.0520$) to this multiple regression model ($\\hat{\\beta} = 0.00525$): a 10-fold decrease. Next we apply the PCA transformation in a few steps, and show some of the results below: In [6]: # create/fit the 'full' pca transformation pca = PCA () . fit ( X ) # apply the pca transformation to the full predictor set pcaX = pca . transform ( X ) # convert to a data frame pcaX_df = pd .

What doss $w_1$ represent based on the untransformed data? What doss $w_1$ represent based on the standardized data? Which is a better representation of the data? your answer here $w_1$ represents the transformation (change in basis) to convert the columns of $\\mathbf{X}$ to the first PCA vector, $z_1$. They elements after quaring sum up to 1, so the magnitude represents euclidean weighting in the transformation (the larger value means more weight in the transformation). In [9]: np . sum ( pca . components_ [ 0 ,:] ** 2 ) Out[9]: 1.0000000000000007 It is common for a model with high dimensional data (lots of predictors) to be plotted along the first 2 PCA components (with the classification boundaries added). Below is the scatter plot for these data (without a classificaiton boundary, since we do not have a model yet): In [10]: # Plot the response over the first 2 PCA component vectors fig ,( ax1 , ax2 ) = plt . subplots ( 1 , 2 , figsize = ( 12 , 5 )) ax1 . scatter ( pcaX_df [[ 'PCA1' ]][ y == 0 ], pcaX_df [[ 'PCA2' ]][ y == 0 ]) ax1 . scatter ( pcaX_df [[ 'PCA1' ]][ y == 1 ], pcaX_df [[ 'PCA2' ]][ y == 1 ]) ax1 . legend ([ \"AHD = No\" , \"AHD = Yes\" ]) ax1 . set_xlabel ( \"First PCA Component Vector\" ) ax1 . set_ylabel ( \"Second PCA Component Vector\" ); ax2 . scatter ( pcaZ_df [[ 'PCA1' ]][ y == 0 ], pcaZ_df [[ 'PCA2' ]][ y == 0 ]) ax2 . scatter ( pcaZ_df [[ 'PCA1' ]][ y == 1 ], pcaZ_df [[ 'PCA2' ]][ y == 1 ]) ax2 . legend ([ \"AHD = No\" , \"AHD = Yes\" ]) ax2 . set_xlabel ( \"First PCA Component Vector (on standardized data)\" ) ax2 . set_ylabel ( \"Second PCA Component Vector (on standardized data)\" ); Out[10]: Text(0, 0.5, 'Second PCA Component Vector (on standardized data)') Q2.4 Does there appear to be good potential here? Which form of the data appear to provide better information as to seperate the classes in the response? What at would a classification boundary look like if a logistic regression model were fit using the first 2 principal components as the predictors? your answer here It would again be linear. Here, most likely the boundary would be a line with negative slope. Part 2: PCA in Regression (PCR) First let's fit the full logistic regression model to predict AHD from the 7 predictors above. Remember: PCA is an approach to handling the predictors (unsupervised), so it does not matter if we are using it for a regression or classification type problem. In [11]: #fit the 'full' model on the 7 predictors. and print out the coefficients logit_full = LogisticRegression ( penalty = \"none\" , solver = \"lbfgs\" , max_iter = 2000 ) . fit ( X , y ) beta = logit_full . coef_ [ 0 ] print ( beta ) [ 0.01194387 0.01540617 0.00698371 -0.03597127 1.74038737 0.55627766 0.30007484] Below is the result of the PCR-1 (logistic) to predict AHD from the first principal component vector. In [12]: logit_pcr1 = LogisticRegression ( penalty = \"none\" , solver = \"lbfgs\" ) . fit ( pcaX_df [[ 'PCA1' ]], y ) print ( \"Intercept from simple PCR-Logistic:\" , logit_pcr1 . intercept_ ) print ( \"'Slope' from simple PCR-Logistic:\" , logit_pcr1 . coef_ ) print ( \"First PCA Component (w1):\" , pca . components_ [ 0 : 1 ,:]) Intercept from simple PCR-Logistic: [-0.16620988] 'Slope' from simple PCR-Logistic: [[0.00351119]] First PCA Component (w1): [[ 3.84007875e-02 5.04636205e-02 9.97978046e-01 -3.74374033e-03 -1.80930152e-03 1.15452228e-03 -3.60044587e-06]] Q2.1 What does this PCR-1 model tell us about how the predictors relate to the response (aka, estimate the coefficient(s) in the original predictor space)? Is it truly a simple logistic regression model in the original predictor space? In [13]: # your code here: do a multiplication of pcr_1's coefficients times the first component vector from PCA ( logit_pcr1 . coef_ * pca . components_ [ 0 : 1 ,:]) Out[13]: array([[ 1.34832630e-04, 1.77187582e-04, 3.50409493e-03, -1.31450001e-05, -6.35280937e-06, 4.05375218e-06, -1.26418654e-08]]) your answer here The estimated slope from PCR1 ( $\\hat{\\beta}= 0.00351092$) is distributed across the 4 actual predictors, so that the formula would be: $$\\hat{y} = 0.00351(Z_1) = 0.00351(w&#94;T_1\\mathbf{X}) = 0.00351(0.0384X_1+0.0505X_2+0.998X_3-0.0037X_4) \\\\ = 0.000135X_1+0.000177X_2+0.00350X_3-0.0000131X_4) $$ This is how to interpret the estimated coefficients from a regression with PCA components as the predictors: some transformation back to the original space is required. Here is the above claculation fora few up tothe 7th PCR logistic regression, and then plotted on a 'pretty' plot: In [14]: # Fit the other 3 PCRs on the rest of the 7 predictors #pcaX_df.iloc[:,np.arange(0,5)].head() logit_pcr2 = LogisticRegression ( C = 1000000 , solver = \"lbfgs\" ) . fit ( pcaX_df [[ 'PCA1' , 'PCA2' ]], y ) logit_pcr3 = LogisticRegression ( C = 1000000 , solver = \"lbfgs\" ) . fit ( pcaX_df [[ 'PCA1' , 'PCA2' , 'PCA3' ]], y ) logit_pcr4 = LogisticRegression ( C = 1000000 , solver = \"lbfgs\" ) . fit ( pcaX_df [[ 'PCA1' , 'PCA2' , 'PCA3' , 'PCA4' ]], y ) logit_pcr5 = LogisticRegression ( C = 1000000 , solver = \"lbfgs\" ) . fit ( pcaX_df [[ 'PCA1' , 'PCA2' , 'PCA3' , 'PCA4' , 'PCA5' ]], y ) logit_pcr6 = LogisticRegression ( C = 1000000 , solver = \"lbfgs\" ) . fit ( pcaX_df [[ 'PCA1' , 'PCA2' , 'PCA3' , 'PCA4' , 'PCA5' , 'PCA6' ]], y ) logit_pcr7 = LogisticRegression ( C = 1000000 , solver = \"lbfgs\" ) . fit ( pcaX_df , y ) pcr1 = ( logit_pcr1 . coef_ * np . transpose ( pca . components_ [ 0 : 1 ,:])) . sum ( axis = 1 ) pcr2 = ( logit_pcr2 . coef_ * np . transpose ( pca . components_ [ 0 : 2 ,:])) . sum ( axis = 1 ) pcr3 = ( logit_pcr3 . coef_ * np . transpose ( pca . components_ [ 0 : 3 ,:])) . sum ( axis = 1 ) pcr4 = ( logit_pcr4 . coef_ * np . transpose ( pca . components_ [ 0 : 4 ,:])) . sum ( axis = 1 ) pcr5 = ( logit_pcr5 . coef_ * np . transpose ( pca . components_ [ 0 : 5 ,:])) . sum ( axis = 1 ) pcr6 = ( logit_pcr6 . coef_ * np . transpose ( pca . components_ [ 0 : 6 ,:])) . sum ( axis = 1 ) pcr7 = ( logit_pcr7 . coef_ * np . transpose ( pca . components_ [ 0 : 7 ,:])) . sum ( axis = 1 ) results = np . vstack (( pcr1 , pcr2 , pcr3 , pcr4 , pcr5 , pcr6 , pcr7 , beta )) print ( results ) [[ 1.34832630e-04 1.77187582e-04 3.50409493e-03 -1.31450001e-05 -6.35280937e-06 4.05375218e-06 -1.26418654e-08] [ 8.22888139e-03 4.90460029e-03 3.52035681e-03 -4.36772643e-02 3.00832874e-05 8.05215560e-04 4.64728134e-04] [ 9.67851637e-03 1.57232886e-02 2.98524575e-03 -4.25103732e-02 1.66262028e-05 9.08384148e-04 4.91486409e-04] [ 4.87937328e-03 1.65220860e-02 3.12832994e-03 -4.33112238e-02 3.92241495e-05 9.15507194e-04 5.08938426e-04] [ 1.97160112e-03 1.21592916e-02 3.37846293e-03 -3.28220970e-02 3.64476979e-02 6.57141425e-01 2.16558303e-01] [ 1.76384914e-03 1.28415055e-02 3.91486367e-03 -3.62050051e-02 3.73981251e-01 8.31601131e-01 -3.35831180e-01] [ 1.19527616e-02 1.54021528e-02 6.98403516e-03 -3.59641629e-02 1.74063117e+00 5.56305309e-01 3.00152829e-01] [ 1.19438739e-02 1.54061660e-02 6.98371275e-03 -3.59712705e-02 1.74038737e+00 5.56277658e-01 3.00074835e-01]] In [15]: plt . plot ([ 'PCR1' , 'PCR2' , 'PCR3' , 'PCR4' , 'PCR5' , 'PCR6' , 'PCR7' , 'Logistic' ], results ) plt . ylabel ( \"Back-calculated Beta Coefficients\" ); #plt.legend(X.columns); Out[15]: Text(0, 0.5, 'Back-calculated Beta Coefficients') Q2.5 Interpret the plot above. Specifically, compare how each PCA vector \"contributes\" to the original logistic regression model using all 7 original predictors. How Does PCR-4 compare to the original logistic regression model (in estimated coefficients)? your answer here This plot shows that as more PCA vectors are included in the PCA-Regression, the estimated $\\beta$s from the original regression model are recovered: if PCR($p$) is used (where $p$ is the number of predictors we started with), they are mathemtaically equivalent.

What does this illustrate? Solution: This plot shows that the components are now more evenly composed of the predictors, rather than the first component being dominated by the predictor with the most variability. The 4 lines move more similarly here than in th eprevious plot where they essentially moved one predictor for one component. In [19]:",

Table of Contents PCA Refresher Distance Metrics Clustering Algorithms and Measuring Quality of Clusters Unsupervised Learning and Classification Review : What is unsupervised learning? What does it mean to perform classification? 1. PCA Refresher image source: [1] Review What is PCA? How can it be useful? What are its limitations? image source: [1] Sklearn's sklearn.decomposition.PCA uses the LAPACK library written in Fortran 90 (based on the LINPACK library from the 70s) which provides routines for solving systems of simultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions of linear systems of equations. How to use the sklearn PCA package: a. Instantiate a new PCA object: pca_transformer = PCA() b. Fit some data (learns the transformation based on this data): fitted_pca = pca_transformer.fit(data_frame) c. Transform the data to the reduced dimensions: pca_df = fitted_pca.transform(data_frame) Using two distinct steps (i.e., (b) and (c)) to fit and transform our data allows one the flexibility to transform any dataset according to our learned fit() . Alternatively, if you know you only want to transform a single dataset, you can combine (b) and (c) into one step: Fit and transform: pca_df = pca_transformer.fit_transform(pca_df) Note: We fit on the training set and transform both training and test set. Example: Playing with synthetic data Sklearn has some wonderful methods for generating synthetic datasets . They can be quite useful for testing clustering for classification purposes.

(edited from Wikipedia.org) Euclidean distance: The Euclidean distance measures the shortest path between the two points, navigating through all dimensions: $d(\\textbf{p}, \\textbf{q}) = \\lVert \\textbf{p} - \\textbf{q} \\rVert = \\sqrt{{(p_1-q_1)}&#94;2+{(p_2-q_2)}&#94;2}$ For vectors in $\\mathbb{R}&#94;n$: $d(\\textbf{p}, \\textbf{q}) = \\lVert \\textbf{p} - \\textbf{q} \\rVert = \\sqrt{{(p_1-q_1)}&#94;2+{(p_2-q_2)}&#94;2+\\cdots +{(p_n-q_n)}&#94;2}$ Manhattan distance: The Manhattan distance measures the cumulative difference between the two points, across all dimensions. $d_1(\\textbf{p}, \\textbf{q}) = \\lVert \\textbf{p} - \\textbf{q} \\rVert_1 = \\sum_{i=1}&#94;{n} \\mid p_i-q_1 \\mid$ Cosine distance (extra) $\\cos{\\theta} = \\frac{\\textbf{q}\\textbf{q}}{\\lVert \\textbf{p}\\rVert \\lVert\\textbf{q} \\rVert} $ In [7]: from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer from scipy.spatial import distance count_vect = CountVectorizer () sent0 = \"Biden is here\" sent1 = \"President is coming here\" corpus = [ sent0 , sent1 ] sentences = count_vect . fit_transform ( corpus ) v1 = sentences . toarray ()[ 0 ] v2 = sentences . toarray ()[ 1 ] print ( f 'v1 = { v1 } , \\n v2 = { v2 } ' ) # pretty print df = pd .

Cosine metric is used in Collaborative Filtering (Recommender systems for movies). More on cosine distance on the second part of the class. Hamming Distance (extra): If our two elements of comparison can be represented a sequence of discrete items, it can be useful to measure how many of their elements differ. For example: Mahmoud and Mahmood differ by just 1 character and thus have a hamming distance of 1. 10101 and 01101 have a hamming distance of 2. Mary and Barry have a hamming distance of 3 (m->b, y->r, null->y). Note : the last example may seem sub-optimal, as we could transform Mary to Barry by just 2 operations (substituting the M with a B, then adding an 'r'). So, their so-called edit distance is smaller than their Hamming distance. The very related Levenshtein distance here can handle this, and thus tends to be more appropriate for Strings. 3 - Clustering Algorithms Question: Why do we care about clustering? How/why is it useful? We will now walk through three clustering algorithms, first discussing them at a high-level, then showing how to implement them with Python libraries. Let's first load and scale our data, so that particular dimensions don't naturally dominate in their contributions in the distant calculations: In [8]: multishapes = pd . read_csv ( \"data/multishapes.csv\" ) # loads x,y columns of a dataset ms_df = multishapes [[ 'x' , 'y' ]] ms_df . plot . scatter ( x = 'x' , y = 'y' , c = 'Blue' , \\ title = \"Multishapes data\" , \\ figsize = ( 5.5 , 4.2 )) plt . show () ms_df . head () Out[8]: x y 0 -0.803739 -0.853053 1 0.852851 0.367618 2 0.927180 -0.274902 3 -0.752626 -0.511565 4 0.706846 0.810679 In [9]: # displays our summary statistics of our data ms_df . describe () Out[9]: x y count 1100.000000 1100.000000 mean -0.081222 -0.625431 std 0.644967 1.176170 min -1.489180 -3.353462 25% -0.478839 -1.126752 50% -0.132920 -0.297040 75% 0.366072 0.250817 max 1.492208 1.253874 In [10]: from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler scaler = StandardScaler () scaler = scaler . fit ( ms_df ) print ( scaler . mean_ ) scaled_df = scaler . transform ( ms_df ) ###### if I had a test set I would transform here: # test_scaled_df = scaler.transform(test_df) ################################################## scaled_df = pd .

If you have a training and a test set, always .fit() your scaler only to the training set, and then .transform() both sets. Let's plot this data with and without scaling In [11]: # plot our data msplot = ms_df . plot . scatter ( x = 'x' , y = 'y' , c = 'Black' , \\ title = \"Multishapes data (no scaling)\" , \\ figsize = ( 5.5 , 4.2 )) msplot . set_xlabel ( \"X\" ) msplot . set_ylabel ( \"Y\" ) plt . show () In [12]: # plots our data msplot = scaled_df . plot . scatter ( x = 'x' , y = 'y' , c = 'Black' , \\ title = \"Multishapes data (w/ scaling)\" , \\ figsize = ( 5.5 , 4.2 )) msplot . set_xlabel ( \"X\" ) msplot . set_ylabel ( \"Y\" ) plt . show () 3a. k-Means clustering: Code (via sklearn ): In [13]: from sklearn.cluster import KMeans ms_kmeans = KMeans ( n_clusters = 2 , init = 'random' , n_init = 3 , random_state = 109 ) . fit ( scaled_df ) That's it! Just 1 line of code! Now that we've run k-Means, we can look at various attributes of our clusters. Full documenation is here . In [14]: display ( ms_kmeans . cluster_centers_ ) display ( ms_kmeans . labels_ [ 0 : 10 ]) array([[-1.02507148, -0.98833731], [ 0.42239787, 0.40726094]]) array([0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], dtype=int32) Plotting Take note of matplotlib's c= argument to color items in the plot, along with our stacking two different plotting functions in the same plot. In [15]: plt . figure ( figsize = ( 10 , 10 )) plt . scatter ( scaled_df [ 'x' ], scaled_df [ 'y' ], c = ms_kmeans . labels_ ); plt . scatter ( ms_kmeans . cluster_centers_ [:, 0 ], ms_kmeans . cluster_centers_ [:, 1 ], c = 'r' , marker = 'h' , s = 100 ); Out[15]: Question : Is this expected or did something go wrong? Lessons: Initializations matter; run multiple times k-Means can struggle with clusters that are close together; they can get lumped into one There's no notion of 'not part of any cluster' or 'part of two clusters' (see Gaussian Mixture Models for this). Visualization here Breakroom Exercise : With your room, collectively discuss how k-means works. Create a synthetic data set with a few clusters and explore using K-means. Quality of Clusters: Inertia Inertia measures the total squared distance from points to their cluster's centroid. We obviously want this distance to be relatively small. If we increase the number of clusters, it will naturally make the average distance smaller. If every point has its own cluster, then our distance would be 0. That's obviously not an ideal way to cluster. One way to determine a reasonable number of clusters to simply try many different clusterings as we vary k , and each time, measure the overall inertia. In [16]: wss = [] for i in range ( 1 , 11 ): fitx = KMeans ( n_clusters = i , init = 'random' , n_init = 5 , random_state = 109 ) . fit ( scaled_df ) wss . append ( fitx . inertia_ ) plt . figure ( figsize = ( 11 , 8.5 )) plt . plot ( range ( 1 , 11 ), wss , 'bx-' ) plt . xlabel ( 'Number of clusters $k$' ) plt . ylabel ( 'Inertia' ) plt . title ( 'The Elbow Method showing the optimal $k$' ) plt . show () Look for the place(s) where distance stops decreasing as much (i.e., the 'elbow' of the curve). It seems that 4 would be a good number of clusters, as a higher k yields diminishing returns. Exercise : Run K-means again with 4 clusters this time. Quality of Clusters: Silhouette Let's say we have a data point $i$, and the cluster it belongs to is referred to as $C(i)$. One way to measure the quality of a cluster $C(i)$ is to measure how close its data points are to each other (within-cluster) compared to nearby, other clusters $C(j)$. This is what Silhouette Scores provide for us. The range is [-1,1]; 0 indicates a point on the decision boundary (equal average closeness to points intra-cluster and out-of-cluster), and negative values mean that datum might be better in a different cluster. Specifically, let $a(i)$ denote the average distance data point $i$ is to the other points in the same cluster: Similarly, we can also compute the average distance that data point $i$ is to all other clusters. The cluster that yields the minimum distance is denoted by $b(i)$: Hopefully our data point $i$ is much closer, on average, to points within its own cluster (i.e., $a(i)$ than it is to its closest neighboring cluster $b(i)$). The silhouette score quantifies this as $s(i)$: NOTE: If data point $i$ belongs to its own cluster (no other points), then the silhouette score is set to 0 (otherwise, $a(i)$ would be undefined). The silhouette score plotted below is the overall average across all points in our dataset. The silhouette_score() function is available in sklearn . We can manually loop over values of K (for applying k-Means algorithm), then plot its silhouette score. In [17]: from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score scores = [ 0 ] for i in range ( 2 , 11 ): fitx = KMeans ( n_clusters = i , init = 'random' , n_init = 5 , random_state = 109 ) . fit ( scaled_df ) score = silhouette_score ( scaled_df , fitx . labels_ ) scores . append ( score ) plt . figure ( figsize = ( 11 , 8.5 )) plt . plot ( range ( 1 , 11 ), np . array ( scores ), 'bx-' ) plt . xlabel ( 'Number of clusters $k$' ) plt . ylabel ( 'Average Silhouette' ) plt . title ( 'The Elbow Method showing the optimal $k$' ) plt . show () Visualizing all Silhoutte scores for a particular clustering Below, we borrow from an sklearn example. The second plot may be overkill. The second plot is just the scaled data. It is not a PCA plot If you only need the raw silhouette scores, use the silhouette_samples() function In [18]: from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_samples , silhouette_score import matplotlib.cm as cm #modified code from http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_kmeans_silhouette_analysis.html def silplot ( X , clusterer , pointlabels = None ): cluster_labels = clusterer . labels_ n_clusters = clusterer . n_clusters # Create a subplot with 1 row and 2 columns fig , ( ax1 , ax2 ) = plt . subplots ( 1 , 2 ) fig . set_size_inches ( 11 , 8.5 ) # The 1st subplot is the silhouette plot # The silhouette coefficient can range from -1, 1 but in this example all # lie within [-0.1, 1] ax1 . set_xlim ([ - 0.1 , 1 ]) # The (n_clusters+1)*10 is for inserting blank space between silhouette # plots of individual clusters, to demarcate them clearly. ax1 . set_ylim ([ 0 , len ( X ) + ( n_clusters + 1 ) * 10 ]) # The silhouette_score gives the average value for all the samples. # This gives a perspective into the density and separation of the formed # clusters silhouette_avg = silhouette_score ( X , cluster_labels ) print ( \"For n_clusters = \" , n_clusters , \", the average silhouette_score is \" , silhouette_avg , \".\" , sep = \"\" ) # Compute the silhouette scores for each sample sample_silhouette_values = silhouette_samples ( X , cluster_labels ) y_lower = 10 for i in range ( 0 , n_clusters + 1 ): # Aggregate the silhouette scores for samples belonging to # cluster i, and sort them ith_cluster_silhouette_values = \\ sample_silhouette_values [ cluster_labels == i ] ith_cluster_silhouette_values . sort () size_cluster_i = ith_cluster_silhouette_values . shape [ 0 ] y_upper = y_lower + size_cluster_i color = cm . nipy_spectral ( float ( i ) / n_clusters ) ax1 . fill_betweenx ( np . arange ( y_lower , y_upper ), 0 , ith_cluster_silhouette_values , facecolor = color , edgecolor = color , alpha = 0.7 ) # Label the silhouette plots with their cluster numbers at the middle ax1 . text ( - 0.05 , y_lower + 0.5 * size_cluster_i , str ( i )) # Compute the new y_lower for next plot y_lower = y_upper + 10 # 10 for the 0 samples ax1 . set_title ( \"The silhouette plot for the various clusters.\" ) ax1 . set_xlabel ( \"The silhouette coefficient values\" ) ax1 . set_ylabel ( \"Cluster label\" ) # The vertical line for average silhouette score of all the values ax1 . axvline ( x = silhouette_avg , color = \"red\" , linestyle = \"--\" ) ax1 . set_yticks ([]) # Clear the yaxis labels / ticks ax1 . set_xticks ([ - 0.1 , 0 , 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.6 , 0.8 , 1 ]) # 2nd Plot showing the actual clusters formed colors = cm . nipy_spectral ( cluster_labels . astype ( float ) / n_clusters ) ax2 . scatter ( X [:, 0 ], X [:, 1 ], marker = '.' , s = 200 , lw = 0 , alpha = 0.7 , c = colors , edgecolor = 'k' ) xs = X [:, 0 ] ys = X [:, 1 ] if pointlabels is not None : for i in range ( len ( xs )): plt . text ( xs [ i ], ys [ i ], pointlabels [ i ]) # Labeling the clusters centers = clusterer . cluster_centers_ # Draw white circles at cluster centers ax2 . scatter ( centers [:, 0 ], centers [:, 1 ], marker = 'o' , c = \"white\" , alpha = 1 , s = 200 , edgecolor = 'k' ) for i , c in enumerate ( centers ): ax2 . scatter ( c [ 0 ], c [ 1 ], marker = '$ %d $' % int ( i ), alpha = 1 , s = 50 , edgecolor = 'k' ) ax2 . set_title ( \"The visualization of the clustered data.\" ) ax2 . set_xlabel ( \"Feature space for the 1st feature\" ) ax2 . set_ylabel ( \"Feature space for the 2nd feature\" ) plt . suptitle (( \"Silhouette analysis for KMeans clustering on sample data \" \"with n_clusters = %d \" % n_clusters ), fontsize = 14 , fontweight = 'bold' ) In [19]: # run k-means with 3 clusters ms_kmeans = KMeans ( n_clusters = 4 , init = 'random' , n_init = 3 , random_state = 109 ) . fit ( scaled_df ) # plot a fancy silhouette plot silplot ( scaled_df . values , ms_kmeans ) For n_clusters = 4, the average silhouette_score is 0.4588053944508592. Food for thought : Using the silhouette scores' optimal number of clusters (per the elbow plot above): Fit a new k-Means model with that many clusters Plot the clusters like we originally did with k-means Plot the silhouette scores just like the above cells Which seems like a better clustering (i.e., 3 clusters or the number returned by the elbow plot above)? In [20]: Quality of Clusters: Gap Statistic The gap statistic compares within-cluster distances (such as in silhouette), but instead of comparing against the second-best existing cluster for that point, it compares our clustering's overall average to the average we'd see if the data were generated at random (we'd expect randomly generated data to not necessarily have any inherit patterns that can be easily clustered). In essence, the within-cluster distances (in the elbow plot) will go down just becuse we have more clusters. We additionally calculate how much they'd go down on non-clustered data with the same spread as our data and subtract that trend out to produce the plot below. The original paper is : \" Estimating the number of clusters in a data set via the gap statistic \" (Tibshirani et al.). As suggested in the paper, we would choose the value of $\\hat{k}$ (number of clusters) such that $\\hat{k}$ = smallest $k$ such that Gap($k$) $\\geq$ Gap($k+1$) - $s_{k+1}$. We compare the actual Gap value of the k point to the lower bar of the Gap value of the k+1 point. The following graph should make it clearer. The plot is from the original paper (Fig. 2) (dashed lines are mine) We could argue that we should have chosen the largest value (k =3) instead of the first value that satisfies the Gap statistic equation (k=1 in this case). If you're able to compute for a range of k, then you can choose the maximum. For example, in the graph above, since we're computing over k=1,..,10, we could choose k=3. The original paper although it suggests that we look at the whole range, chooses k=1 in the case above; if you see the raw data plotted (Fig. 2 in the paper) you will also notice that there is really not much structure for cluster subdivision but we should always investigate the whole plot. Also, it's very computationally intensive to compute the Gap statistic. Additionally, you can use domain knowledge or whatever information you have about the data to choose k. The gap statistic is implemented by Miles Granger in the gap_statistic Python library. The library also implements the Gap$&#94;*$ statistic described in \" A comparison of Gap statistic definitions with and with-out logarithm function \" (Mohajer, M., Englmeier, K. H., & Schmid, V. J., 2011) which is less conservative but tends to perform suboptimally when clusters overlap.

Agglomerative Clustering Code (via scipy ): There are many different cluster-merging criteria, one of which is Ward's criteria. Ward's optimizes having the lowest total within-cluster distances, so it merges the two clusters that will harm this objective least. scipy 's agglomerative clustering function implements Ward's method. In [28]: import scipy.cluster.hierarchy as hac from scipy.spatial.distance import pdist plt . figure ( figsize = ( 11 , 8.5 )) dist_mat = pdist ( scaled_df , metric = \"euclidean\" ) ward_data = hac . ward ( dist_mat ) hac . dendrogram ( ward_data ); plt . show () Discussion : How do you read a plot like the above? What are valid options for number of clusters, and how can you tell? Are some more valid than others? Does it make sense to compute silhouette scores for an agglomerative clustering? If we wanted to compute silhouette scores, what would we need for this to be possible? Lessons: It's expensive: O(n&#94;3) time complexity and O(n&#94;2) space complexity. Many choices for linkage criteria Every node gets clustered (no child left behind) In [29]: 3c. DBSCAN Clustering DBSCAN uses an intuitive notion of denseness to define clusters, rather than defining clusters by a central point as in k-means. Code (via sklearn ): DBscan is implemented in good 'ol sklearn, but there aren't great automated tools for searching for the optimal epsilon parameter. For full documentation, please visit this page In [30]: from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN plt . figure ( figsize = ( 11 , 8.5 )) fitted_dbscan = DBSCAN ( eps = 0.2 ) . fit ( scaled_df ) plt . scatter ( scaled_df [ 'x' ], scaled_df [ 'y' ], c = fitted_dbscan . labels_ ); Out[30]: Note: the dark purple dots are not clustered with anything else. They are lone singletons. You can validate such by setting epsilon to a very small value, and increase the min_samples to a high value. Under these conditions, nothing would cluster, and yet all dots become dark purple. Exercise : Experiment with the above code by changing its epsilon value and the min_samples (what is the default value for it, since the above code doesn't specify a value?) Instead of just empirically observing how the epsilon value affects the clustering (which would be very costly for large, high-dimensional data), we can also inspect how far each data point is to its $N&#94;{th}$ closest neighbor: In [31]: from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors # x-axis is each individual data point, numbered by an artificial index # y-axis is the distance to its 2nd closest neighbor def plot_epsilon ( df , min_samples ): fitted_neigbors = NearestNeighbors ( n_neighbors = min_samples ) . fit ( df ) distances , indices = fitted_neigbors . kneighbors ( df ) dist_to_nth_nearest_neighbor = distances [:, - 1 ] plt . plot ( np . sort ( dist_to_nth_nearest_neighbor )) plt . xlabel ( \"Index \\n (sorted by increasing distances)\" ) plt . ylabel ( \" {} -NN Distance (epsilon)\" . format ( min_samples - 1 )) plt . tick_params ( right = True , labelright = True ) In [32]: plot_epsilon ( scaled_df , 3 ) Lessons: Can cluster non-linear relationships very well; potential for more natural, arbritrarily shaped groupings Does not require specifying the # of clusters (i.e., k ); the algorithm determines such Robust to outliers Very sensitive to the parameters (requires strong knowledge of the data) Doesn't guarantee that every (or ANY) item will be clustered Discussion : When should we prefer one type of clustering over another? Should we always just try all of them? Imagine you work at Spotify and you want to create personalized playlists for each person. One could imagine a dataset exists whereby each row is a particular song, and the columns are features (e.g., tempo (BPM), average vocal frequency, amount of bass, sentiment of lyrics, duration in seconds, etc). Let's use clustering to group one's catalog of favorite music, which will serve as disjoint starting points for suggesting future songs. Specifically, imagine that you've 'liked' 500 songs on Spotify so far, and your recommendation algorithm needs to cluster those 500 songs. Would you first experiment with k-Means, Agglomerative, or DBScan? Why? References: [1] A Tutorial on Principal Component Analysis",

Formulas. 3 - Splines 4 - Generative Additive Models with pyGAM 5 - Smooting Splines using csaps Overview image source: Dani Servén Marín (one of the developers of pyGAM) A - Linear Models First we have the Linear Models which you know from 109a. These models are linear in the coefficients. Very interpretable but suffer from high bias because let's face it, few relationships in life are linear. Simple Linear Regression (defined as a model with one predictor) as well as Multiple Linear Regression (more than one predictors) are examples of LMs. Polynomial Regression extends the linear model by adding terms that are still linear for the coefficients but non-linear when it somes to the predictiors which are now raised in a power or multiplied between them. $$ \\begin{aligned} y = \\beta{_0} + \\beta{_1}{x_1} & \\quad \\mbox{(simple linear regression)}\\\\ y = \\beta{_0} + \\beta{_1}{x_1} + \\beta{_2}{x_2} + \\beta{_3}{x_3} & \\quad \\mbox{(multiple linear regression)}\\\\ y = \\beta{_0} + \\beta{_1}{x_1} + \\beta{_2}{x_1&#94;2} + \\beta{_3}{x_3&#94;3} & \\quad \\mbox{(polynomial multiple regression)}\\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ Questions to think about What does it mean for a model to be interpretable ? Are linear regression models interpretable? Are random forests? What about Neural Networks such as Feed Forward? Do we always want interpretability? Describe cases where we do and cases where we do not care. B - Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) Generalized Linear Models is a term coined in the early 1970s by Nelder and Wedderburn for a class of models that includes both Linear Regression and Logistic Regression. A GLM fits one coefficient per feature (predictor). C - Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) Hastie and Tidshirani coined the term Generalized Additive Models in 1986 for a class of non-linear extensions to Generalized Linear Models. $$ \\begin{aligned} y = \\beta{_0} + f_1\\left(x_1\\right) + f_2\\left(x_2\\right) + f_3\\left(x_3\\right) \\\\ y = \\beta{_0} + f_1\\left(x_1\\right) + f_2\\left(x_2, x_3\\right) + f_3\\left(x_3\\right) & \\mbox{(with interaction terms)} \\end{aligned} $$ In practice we add splines and regularization via smoothing penalties to our GLMs. image source: Dani Servén Marín D - Basis Functions In our models we can use various types of functions as \"basis\". Monomials such as $x&#94;2$, $x&#94;4$ ( Polynomial Regression ) Sigmoid functions (neural networks) Fourier functions Wavelets Regression splines 1 - Piecewise Polynomials a.k.a. Splines Splines are a type of piecewise polynomial interpolant. A spline of degree k is a piecewise polynomial that is continuously differentiable k − 1 times. Splines are the basis of CAD software and vector graphics including a lot of the fonts used in your computer. The name \"spline\" comes from a tool used by ship designers to draw smooth curves. Here is the letter $epsilon$ written with splines: font idea inspired by Chris Rycroft (AM205) If the degree is 1 then we have a Linear Spline. If it is 3 then we have a Cubic spline. It turns out that cubic splines because they have a continous 2nd derivative (curvature) at the knots are very smooth to the eye. We do not need higher order than that. The Cubic Splines are usually Natural Cubic Splines which means they have the added constrain of the end points' second derivative = 0. We will use the CubicSpline and the B-Spline as well as the Linear Spline. scipy.interpolate See all the different splines that scipy.interpolate has to offer: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/interpolate.html Let's use the simplest form which is interpolate on a set of points and then find the points between them. In [3]: from scipy.interpolate import splrep , splev from scipy.interpolate import BSpline , CubicSpline from scipy.interpolate import interp1d # define the range of the function a = - 1 b = 1 # define the number of knots num_knots = 11 knots = np . linspace ( a , b , num_knots ) # define the function we want to approximate y = 1 / ( 1 + 25 * ( knots ** 2 )) # make a linear spline linspline = interp1d ( knots , y ) # sample at these points to plot xx = np . linspace ( a , b , 1000 ) yy = 1 / ( 1 + 25 * ( xx ** 2 )) plt . plot ( knots , y , '*' ) plt . plot ( xx , yy , label = 'true function' ) plt . plot ( xx , linspline ( xx ), label = 'linear spline' ); plt . legend (); Out[3]: Exercise The Linear interpolation does not look very good.

What would happen if we run a polynomial model of degree equal to the number of knots (a global one as in polynomial regression, not a spline)? What makes a spline 'Natural'? In [6]: # Optional and Outside of the scope of this class: create the `epsilon` in the figure above x = np . array ([ 1. , 0. , - 1.5 , 0. , - 1.5 , 0. ]) y = np . array ([ 1.5 , 1. , 2.5 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]) t = np . linspace ( 0 , 5 , 6 ) f = interp1d ( t , x , kind = 'cubic' ) g = interp1d ( t , y , kind = 'cubic' ) tplot = np . linspace ( 0 , 5 , 200 ) plt . plot ( x , y , '*' , f ( tplot ), g ( tplot )); Out[6]: [ , ] B-Splines (de Boor, 1978) One way to construct a curve given a set of points is to interpolate the points , that is, to force the curve to pass through the points. A B-splines (Basis Splines) is defined by a set of control points and a set of basis functions that fit the function between these points. By choosing to have no smoothing factor we force the final B-spline to pass though all the points. If, on the other hand, we set a smothing factor, our function is more of an approximation with the control points as \"guidance\". The latter produced a smoother curve which is prefferable for drawing software. For more on Splines see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline ) We will use scipy.splrep to calulate the coefficients for the B-Spline and draw it.

The t variable is the array that contains the knots' position in the x axis. The length of this array is, of course, the number of knots. The c variable is the array that holds the coefficients for the B-Spline. Its length should be the same as t . We have number_of_knots - 1 B-spline basis elements to the spline constructed via this method, and they are defined as follows: $$ \\begin{aligned} B_{i, 0}(x) = 1, \\textrm{if $t i \\le x < t {i+1}$, otherwise $0$,} \\ \\ B_{i, k}(x) = \\frac{x - t i}{t {i+k} - t i} B {i, k-1}(x) + \\frac{t_{i+k+1} - x}{t_{i+k+1} - t_{i+1}} B_{i+1, k-1}(x) \\end{aligned} $$ t $\\in [t_1, t_2, ..., t_]$ is the knot vector c : are the spline coefficients k : is the spline degree B-Spline with smooting factor s In [9]: from scipy.interpolate import splev , splrep x = np . linspace ( 0 , 10 , 5 ) y = np . sin ( x ) s = 0.5 # add smoothing factor task = 0 # task needs to be set to 0, which represents: # we are specifying a smoothing factor and thus only want # splrep() to find the optimal t and c t , c , k = splrep ( x , y , task = task , s = s ) # draw the line segments linspline = interp1d ( x , y ) # define the points to plot on (x2) x2 = np . linspace ( 0 , 10 , 200 ) y2 = BSpline ( t , c , k ) plt . plot ( x , y , 'o' , x2 , y2 ( x2 )) plt . plot ( x2 , linspline ( x2 )) plt . show () B-Spline with given knots In [10]: x = np . linspace ( 0 , 10 , 100 ) y = np . sin ( x ) knots = np . quantile ( x , [ 0.25 , 0.5 , 0.75 ]) print ( knots ) [2.5 5. 7.5] In [11]: # calculate the B-Spline t , c , k = splrep ( x , y , t = knots ) In [12]: curve = BSpline ( t , c , k ) curve Out[12]: In [13]: plt . scatter ( x = x , y = y , c = 'grey' , alpha = 0.4 ) yknots = np . sin ( knots ) plt . scatter ( knots , yknots , c = 'r' ) plt . plot ( x , curve ( x )) plt . show () 2 - GAMs https://readthedocs.org/projects/pygam/downloads/pdf/latest/ Classification in pyGAM Let's get our (multivariate!) data, the kyphosis dataset, and the LogisticGAM model from pyGAM to do binary classification. kyphosis - wherther a particular deformation was present post-operation age - patient's age in months number - the number of vertebrae involved in the operation start - the number of the topmost vertebrae operated on In [14]: kyphosis = pd . read_csv ( \"data/kyphosis.csv\" ) display ( kyphosis . head ()) display ( kyphosis . describe ( include = 'all' )) display ( kyphosis . dtypes ) Kyphosis Age Number Start 0 absent 71 3 5 1 absent 158 3 14 2 present 128 4 5 3 absent 2 5 1 4 absent 1 4 15 Kyphosis Age Number Start count 81 81.000000 81.000000 81.000000 unique 2 NaN NaN NaN top absent NaN NaN NaN freq 64 NaN NaN NaN mean NaN 83.654321 4.049383 11.493827 std NaN 58.104251 1.619423 4.883962 min NaN 1.000000 2.000000 1.000000 25% NaN 26.000000 3.000000 9.000000 50% NaN 87.000000 4.000000 13.000000 75% NaN 130.000000 5.000000 16.000000 max NaN 206.000000 10.000000 18.000000 Kyphosis object Age int64 Number int64 Start int64 dtype: object In [15]: # convert the outcome in a binary form, 1 or 0 kyphosis = pd . read_csv ( \"data/kyphosis.csv\" ) kyphosis [ \"outcome\" ] = 1 * ( kyphosis [ \"Kyphosis\" ] == \"present\" ) kyphosis . describe () Out[15]: Age Number Start outcome count 81.000000 81.000000 81.000000 81.000000 mean 83.654321 4.049383 11.493827 0.209877 std 58.104251 1.619423 4.883962 0.409758 min 1.000000 2.000000 1.000000 0.000000 25% 26.000000 3.000000 9.000000 0.000000 50% 87.000000 4.000000 13.000000 0.000000 75% 130.000000 5.000000 16.000000 0.000000 max 206.000000 10.000000 18.000000 1.000000 In [0]: from pygam import LogisticGAM , s , f , l X = kyphosis [[ \"Age\" , \"Number\" , \"Start\" ]] y = kyphosis [ \"outcome\" ] kyph_gam = LogisticGAM () . fit ( X , y ) Outcome dependence on features To help us see how the outcome depends on each feature, pyGAM has the partial_dependence() function. pdep, confi = kyph_gam.partial_dependence(term=i, X=XX, width=0.95) For more on this see the : https://pygam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/logisticgam.html In [21]: res = kyph_gam . deviance_residuals ( X , y ) for i , term in enumerate ( kyph_gam . terms ): if term . isintercept : continue XX = kyph_gam . generate_X_grid ( term = i ) pdep , confi = kyph_gam . partial_dependence ( term = i , X = XX , width = 0.95 ) pdep2 , _ = kyph_gam . partial_dependence ( term = i , X = X , width = 0.95 ) plt . figure () plt . scatter ( X . iloc [:, term . feature ], pdep2 + res ) plt . plot ( XX [:, term . feature ], pdep ) plt . plot ( XX [:, term . feature ], confi , c = 'r' , ls = '--' ) plt . title ( X . columns . values [ term . feature ]) plt . show () Notice that we did not specify the basis functions in the .fit(). pyGAM figures them out for us by using $s()$ (splines) for numerical variables and $f()$ for categorical features.

For this part we will use the wages dataset. https://pygam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/lineargam.html The wages dataset Let's inspect another dataset that is included in pyGAM that notes the wages of people based on their age, year of employment and education.

For csaps : a) input data should be strictly increasing, so no duplicate values (see https://csaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html ). You need to sort the values in an ascending order with no duplicates. b) the smoothing parameter is entered as $\\lambda$ (or p) but it seems to be $1-\\lambda$ (1-p) in the formula. For p=0 we get a straight line, for p=1 there is no smoothing (overfit). In [26]: from csaps import csaps np . random . seed ( 1234 ) x = np . linspace ( 0 , 10 , 300000 ) y = np . sin ( x * 2 * np . pi ) * x + np . random . randn ( len ( x )) xs = np . linspace ( x [ 0 ], x [ - 1 ], 1000 ) ys = csaps ( x , y , xs , smooth = 0.99 ) print ( ys . shape ) #plt.plot(x, y, 'o', xs, ys, '-') plt . plot ( x , y , 'o' , xs , ys , '-' ) plt . show () (1000,) 4 - Data fitting using pyGAM and Penalized B-Splines When we use a spline in pyGAM we are effectively using a penalized B-Spline with a regularization parameter $\\lambda$. E.g. LogisticGAM(s(0)+s(1, lam=0.5)+s(2)).fit(X,y) Let's see how this smoothing works in pyGAM . We start by creating some arbitrary data and fitting them with a GAM. In [27]: X = np . linspace ( 0 , 10 , 500 ) y = np . sin ( X * 2 * np . pi ) * X + np . random . randn ( len ( X )) plt . scatter ( X , y ); In [28]: # let's try a large lambda first and lots of splines gam = LinearGAM ( lam = 1e6 , n_splines = 50 ) . fit ( X , y ) XX = gam . generate_X_grid ( term = 0 ) plt . scatter ( X , y , alpha = 0.3 ); plt . plot ( XX , gam . predict ( XX )); We see that the large $\\lambda$ forces a straight line, no flexibility. Let's see now what happens if we make it smaller. In [29]: # let's try a smaller lambda gam = LinearGAM ( lam = 1e2 , n_splines = 50 ) . fit ( X , y ) XX = gam . generate_X_grid ( term = 0 ) plt . scatter ( X , y , alpha = 0.3 ); plt . plot ( XX , gam . predict ( XX )); There is some curvature there but still not a good fit. Let's try no penalty. That should have the line fit exactly. In [30]: # no penalty, let's try a 0 lambda gam = LinearGAM ( lam = 0 , n_splines = 50 ) . fit ( X , y ) XX = gam . generate_X_grid ( term = 0 ) plt . scatter ( X , y , alpha = 0.3 ) plt . plot ( XX , gam . predict ( XX )) Out[30]: [ ] Yes, that is good. Now let's see what happens if we lessen the number of splines. The fit should not be as good. In [31]: # no penalty, let's try a 0 lambda gam = LinearGAM ( lam = 0 , n_splines = 10 ) . fit ( X , y ) XX = gam . generate_X_grid ( term = 0 ) plt . scatter ( X , y , alpha = 0.3 ); plt . plot ( XX , gam . predict ( XX ));",

These models are linear in the coefficients. Very interpretable but suffer from high bias because let's face it, few relationships in life are linear. Simple Linear Regression (defined as a model with one predictor) as well as Multiple Linear Regression (more than one predictors) are examples of LMs. Polynomial Regression extends the linear model by adding terms that are still linear for the coefficients but non-linear when it somes to the predictiors which are now raised in a power or multiplied between them. $$ \\begin{aligned} y = \\beta{_0} + \\beta{_1}{x_1} & \\quad \\mbox{(simple linear regression)}\\\\ y = \\beta{_0} + \\beta{_1}{x_1} + \\beta{_2}{x_2} + \\beta{_3}{x_3} & \\quad \\mbox{(multiple linear regression)}\\\\ y = \\beta{_0} + \\beta{_1}{x_1} + \\beta{_2}{x_1&#94;2} + \\beta{_3}{x_3&#94;3} & \\quad \\mbox{(polynomial multiple regression)}\\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ Questions to think about What does it mean for a model to be interpretable ? Are linear regression models interpretable? Are random forests? What about Neural Networks such as Feed Forward? Do we always want interpretability? Describe cases where we do and cases where we do not care. B - Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) Generalized Linear Models is a term coined in the early 1970s by Nelder and Wedderburn for a class of models that includes both Linear Regression and Logistic Regression. A GLM fits one coefficient per feature (predictor). C - Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) Hastie and Tidshirani coined the term Generalized Additive Models in 1986 for a class of non-linear extensions to Generalized Linear Models. $$ \\begin{aligned} y = \\beta{_0} + f_1\\left(x_1\\right) + f_2\\left(x_2\\right) + f_3\\left(x_3\\right) \\\\ y = \\beta{_0} + f_1\\left(x_1\\right) + f_2\\left(x_2, x_3\\right) + f_3\\left(x_3\\right) & \\mbox{(with interaction terms)} \\end{aligned} $$ In practice we add splines and regularization via smoothing penalties to our GLMs. image source: Dani Servén Marín D - Basis Functions In our models we can use various types of functions as \"basis\". Monomials such as $x&#94;2$, $x&#94;4$ ( Polynomial Regression ) Sigmoid functions (neural networks) Fourier functions Wavelets Regression splines Smoothing splines 2 - Piecewise Polynomials a.k.a. Splines Splines are a type of piecewise polynomial interpolant. A spline of degree k is a piecewise polynomial that is continuously differentiable k − 1 times. Splines are the basis of CAD software and vector graphics including a lot of the fonts used in your computer. The name \"spline\" comes from a tool used by ship designers to draw smooth curves. Here is the letter $epsilon$ written with splines: font idea inspired by Chris Rycroft (AM205) If the degree is 1 then we have a Linear Spline. If it is 3 then we have a Cubic spline. It turns out that cubic splines because they have a continous 2nd derivative (curvature) at the knots are very smooth to the eye. We do not need higher order than that. The Cubic Splines are usually Natural Cubic Splines which means they have the added constrain of the end points' second derivative = 0. We will use the CubicSpline and the B-Spline as well as the Linear Spline. scipy.interpolate See all the different splines that scipy.interpolate has to offer: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/interpolate.html . These routines are based on the FORTRAN library FITPACK written in the '70s. Let's use the simplest form which is interpolate on a set of points and then find the points between them.

What would happen if we run a polynomial model of degree equal to the number of knots (a global one as in polynomial regression, not a spline)? What makes a spline 'Natural'? In [6]: # Optional and Outside of the scope of this class: create the `epsilon` in the figure above x = np . array ([ 1. , 0. , - 1.5 , 0. , - 1.5 , 0. ]) y = np . array ([ 1.5 , 1. , 2.5 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]) t = np . linspace ( 0 , 5 , 6 ) f = interp1d ( t , x , kind = 'cubic' ) g = interp1d ( t , y , kind = 'cubic' ) tplot = np . linspace ( 0 , 5 , 200 ) plt . plot ( x , y , '*' , f ( tplot ), g ( tplot )); B-Splines (Curry and Schoenberg(1966) , further study by de Boor, 1978) One way to construct a curve given a set of points is to interpolate the points , that is, to force the curve to pass through the points. A B-splines (Basis Splines) is defined by a set of control points and a set of basis functions that fit the function between these points. By choosing to have no smoothing factor we force the final B-spline to pass though all the points. If, on the other hand, we set a smothing factor, our function is more of an approximation with the control points as \"guidance\". The latter produced a smoother curve which is prefferable for drawing software. For more on Splines see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline ) or for a deeper look: De Boor, C. (1978). A practical guide to splines (Applied mathematical sciences (Springer-Verlag New York Inc.) ; v. 27). New York: Springer-Verlag . We will use scipy.splrep to calulate the coefficients for the B-Spline and draw it.

The t variable is the array that contains the knots' position in the x axis. The length of this array is, of course, the number of knots. The c variable is the array that holds the coefficients for the B-Spline. Its length should be the same as t . We have number_of_knots - 1 B-spline basis elements to the spline constructed via this method, and they are defined as follows: $$ \\begin{aligned} B_{i, 0}(x) = 1, \\textrm{if $t i \\le x < t {i+1}$, otherwise $0$,} \\ \\ B_{i, k}(x) = \\frac{x - t i}{t {i+k} - t i} B {i, k-1}(x) + \\frac{t_{i+k+1} - x}{t_{i+k+1} - t_{i+1}} B_{i+1, k-1}(x) \\end{aligned} $$ t $\\in [t_1, t_2, ..., t_n]$ is the knot vector c : are the spline coefficients k : is the spline degree References: All you wanted to know about B-Splines and were afraid to ask, or how scipy.splrep calculates B-spline representations.

In [11]: from scipy.interpolate import splev , splrep from scipy.interpolate import BSpline Constructing the B-spline basis elements The degree of the B-spline, k , is inferred from the length of t as len(t)-2 . The knot vector is constructed by appending and prepending k+1 elements to internal knots t . a) The first element is a B-spline of degree $d=0$ with $1$ knot (min number of knots = $d+2$) $(d=0), B_{i, 0}(x) = 1, \\textrm{if $t i \\le x < t {i+1}$, otherwise $0$, (0 interior knots, 2 total)}$ b) The second element is a B-spline of degree $d=1$ with $2$ knots $(d=1), B_{i, 0}(x) = 1, \\textrm{if $t i \\le x < t {i+1}$, otherwise $0$, (1 interior knot, 3 total)}$ and so on ...

E.g. LogisticGAM(s(0)+s(1, lam=0.5)+s(2)).fit(X,y) Let's see how this smoothing works in pyGAM . We start by creating some arbitrary data and fitting them with a GAM. The lambda parameter (lam) goes from 0 to infinity. The default for the LinearGAM, is 0.6. In [29]: X = np . linspace ( 0 , 10 , 500 ) y = np . sin ( X * 2 * np . pi ) * X + np . random . randn ( len ( X )) plt . scatter ( X , y ); In [30]: # let's try a large lambda first and lots of splines gam = LinearGAM ( lam = 1e6 , n_splines = 50 ) . fit ( X , y ) XX = gam . generate_X_grid ( term = 0 ) plt . scatter ( X , y , alpha = 0.3 ); plt . plot ( XX , gam . predict ( XX )); We see that the large $\\lambda$ forces a straight line, no flexibility. Let's see now what happens if we make it smaller. In [31]: # let's try a smaller lambda gam = LinearGAM ( lam = 1e2 , n_splines = 50 ) . fit ( X , y ) XX = gam . generate_X_grid ( term = 0 ) plt . scatter ( X , y , alpha = 0.3 ); plt . plot ( XX , gam . predict ( XX )); There is some curvature there but still not a good fit. Let's try no penalty. That should have the line fit exactly. In [32]: # no penalty, let's try a 0 lambda gam = LinearGAM ( lam = 0 , n_splines = 50 ) . fit ( X , y ) XX = gam . generate_X_grid ( term = 0 ) plt . scatter ( X , y , alpha = 0.3 ) plt . plot ( XX , gam . predict ( XX )); Yes, that is good. Now let's see what happens if we lessen the number of splines. The fit should not be as good. In [33]: # no penalty, let's try a 0 lambda gam = LinearGAM ( lam = 0 , n_splines = 10 ) . fit ( X , y ) XX = gam . generate_X_grid ( term = 0 ) plt . scatter ( X , y , alpha = 0.3 ); plt . plot ( XX , gam . predict ( XX )); In [34]: # no penalty, let's try a 0 lambda gam = LinearGAM () . fit ( X , y ) XX = gam . generate_X_grid ( term = 0 ) plt . scatter ( X , y , alpha = 0.3 ); plt . plot ( XX , gam . predict ( XX ));",

As usual, we scale the data before applying PCA. (Note that we scale everything, rather than fitting on train and carrying that scaling to future data-- we won't be using a test set here, so it's correct to use all the data to scale). In [5]: from sklearn import preprocessing df = USArrests [[ 'Murder' , 'Assault' , 'UrbanPop' , 'Rape' ]] scaled_df = pd . DataFrame ( preprocessing . scale ( df ), index = USArrests [ 'State' ], columns = df . columns ) fitted_pca = PCA () . fit ( scaled_df ) USArrests_pca = fitted_pca . transform ( scaled_df ) The biplot function plots the first two PCA components, and provides some helpful annotations In [6]: def biplot ( scaled_data , fitted_pca , original_dim_labels , point_labels ): pca_results = fitted_pca . transform ( scaled_data ) pca1_scores = pca_results [:, 0 ] pca2_scores = pca_results [:, 1 ] # plot each point in 2D post-PCA space plt . scatter ( pca1_scores , pca2_scores ) # label each point for i in range ( len ( pca1_scores )): plt . text ( pca1_scores [ i ], pca2_scores [ i ], point_labels [ i ]) #for each original dimension, plot what an increase of 1 in that dimension means in this space for i in range ( fitted_pca . components_ . shape [ 1 ]): raw_dims_delta_on_pca1 = fitted_pca . components_ [ 0 , i ] raw_dims_delta_on_pca2 = fitted_pca . components_ [ 1 , i ] plt . arrow ( 0 , 0 , raw_dims_delta_on_pca1 , raw_dims_delta_on_pca2 , color = 'r' , alpha = 1 ) plt . text ( raw_dims_delta_on_pca1 * 1.1 , raw_dims_delta_on_pca2 * 1.1 , original_dim_labels [ i ], color = 'g' , ha = 'center' , va = 'center' ) plt . figure ( figsize = ( 8.5 , 8.5 )) plt . xlim ( - 3.5 , 3.5 ) plt . ylim ( - 3.5 , 3.5 ) plt . xlabel ( \"PC {} \" . format ( 1 )) plt . ylabel ( \"PC {} \" . format ( 2 )) plt . grid () biplot ( scaled_df , fitted_pca , original_dim_labels = scaled_df . columns , point_labels = USArrests [ 'StateAbbrv' ]) The red arrows and green text give us a sense of direction. If any state had 'murder' increase by one (scaled) unit, it would move in the direction of the 'murder' line by that amount. An increase by one (scaled) unit of both 'murder' and 'Urban Pop' would apply both moves. We can also make inferrences about what combination of crimes and population puts California at its observed point. Extra: Variance Captured As usual, we want to know how what proportion of the variance each PC captures In [7]: plt . figure ( figsize = ( 11 , 8.5 )) plt . plot ( range ( 1 , 5 ), fitted_pca . explained_variance_ratio_ , \"-o\" ) plt . xlabel ( \"Principal Component\" ) plt . ylabel ( \"Proportion of Variance Explained\" ) plt . ylim ( 0 , 1 ) plt . show () print ( \"Proportion of variance explained by each PC:\" ) print ( fitted_pca . explained_variance_ratio_ ) Proportion of variance explained by each PC: [0.62006039 0.24744129 0.0891408 0.04335752] Even more usefully, we can plot how much of the total variation we'd capture by using N PCs. The PCA-2 plot above has 86.7% of the total variance. In [8]: plt . figure ( figsize = ( 11 , 8.5 )) plt . plot ( range ( 1 , 5 ), np . cumsum ( fitted_pca . explained_variance_ratio_ ), \"-o\" ) plt . xlabel ( \"Principal Component\" ) plt . ylabel ( \"Cumulative Proportion of Variance Explained\" ) plt . ylim ( 0 , 1.1 ) plt . show () print ( \"Total variance capturted when using N PCA components:\" ) print ( np . cumsum ( fitted_pca . explained_variance_ratio_ )) Total variance capturted when using N PCA components: [0.62006039 0.86750168 0.95664248 1. ] Scaling and Distances Returning to the arrest/crime data, we again inspect the data and its PCA plot In [9]: np . random . seed ( 123 ) arrests_sample = USArrests . sample ( 6 ) arrests_sample Out[9]: State Murder Assault UrbanPop Rape StateAbbrv 10 Hawaii 5.3 46 83 20.2 HI 13 Indiana 7.2 113 65 21.0 IN 30 New Mexico 11.4 285 70 32.1 NM 46 Washington 4.0 145 73 26.2 WA 18 Maine 2.1 83 51 7.8 ME 0 Alabama 13.2 236 58 21.2 AL In [10]: np . random . seed ( 123 ) np . round ( scaled_df . sample ( 6 ), 2 ) Out[10]: Murder Assault UrbanPop Rape State Hawaii -0.58 -1.51 1.22 -0.11 Indiana -0.14 -0.70 -0.04 -0.03 New Mexico 0.84 1.38 0.31 1.17 Washington -0.88 -0.31 0.52 0.54 Maine -1.32 -1.06 -1.01 -1.45 Alabama 1.26 0.79 -0.53 -0.00 Distances One of the key ideas in clustering is the distance or disimilarity between points. Euclidean distance is common, though one is free to define domain-specific measures of how similar/distant two observations are. In [11]: from scipy.spatial.distance import pdist from scipy.spatial.distance import squareform The pdist function computes the distances between all pairs of data points (which can be quite expensive for large data). squareform turns the result into a numpy array (the raw format avoids storing redundant values) The distances between a handful of states are shown below. Hawaii and Indiana are relatively similar on these variables, while Maine and New Mexico are relatively different. In [12]: dist_eucl = pdist ( scaled_df , metric = \"euclidean\" ) distances = pd .

In [14]: import seaborn as sns plt . figure ( figsize = ( 11 , 8.5 )) sns . heatmap ( distances ) plt . show () Kmeans Kmeans is a classical, workhorse clustering algorithm, and a common place to start.

A hierarchical clustering creates a nesting of clusters as existing clusters are merged or split. Dendograms (literally: branch graphs) can show the pattern of splits/merges.

DB Scan uses a handful of parameters, including the number of neighbors a point must have to be considered 'core' ( min_samples ) and the distance within which neighbors must fall ( epsilon ). Most reasonable values of min_samples yeild the same results, but tuning epsilon is important. The function below implement's the authors suggestion for setting epsilon: look at the nearest-neighbor distances and find a level where they begin to grow rapidly. In [32]: from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors def plot_epsilon ( df , min_samples ): fitted_neigbors = NearestNeighbors ( n_neighbors = min_samples ) . fit ( df ) distances , indices = fitted_neigbors . kneighbors ( df ) dist_to_nth_nearest_neighbor = distances [:, - 1 ] plt . plot ( np . sort ( dist_to_nth_nearest_neighbor )) plt . xlabel ( \"Index \\n (sorted by increasing distances)\" ) plt . ylabel ( \" {} -NN Distance (epsilon)\" . format ( min_samples - 1 )) plt . tick_params ( right = True , labelright = True ) In [33]: plot_epsilon ( ms , 3 ) The major slope occurs around eps=0.15 when min_samples set to 3.

A lower epsilon (0.12) won't quite merge all the clustersWe DBSCAN on crime data Returning to the crime data, let's tune epsilon and see what clusters are returned In [35]: plot_epsilon ( scaled_df , 5 ) The optimal value is either around 1.4 to 1.6. Choosing one versus the other does not result in different clusterings.

Strictly speaking, in linear algebra where a basis for a subspace S of $\\mathbb{R}&#94;n$ is a set of vectors that spans S and is linearly independent. As a reminder, a set of vectors $\\textbf{v}_1, \\textbf{v}_2, ..., \\textbf{v}_k$ are considered linearly independent if they cannot be written as a linear combination of each other, such that, if: $c_1\\textbf{v}_1+c_2\\textbf{v}_2+ ...+ c_k\\textbf{v}_k = \\textbf{0}$ then $c_1,c_2,...,c_k$ are all zero. In data science where we have lots of imperfect data (with errors), as well as imperfect computers (with round-off errors), when we substitute their values into the matrices we almost always get column degeneracy, meaning, some of our columns become linear combinations of each other. Especially so if we use the monomial basis and go beyond ~5,6 degree of the polynomial. Examples are: Monomials such as $x,x&#94;2,x&#94;4,x&#94;5$ Sigmoid/ReLU functions (neural networks) Fourier functions Wavelets Splines The matrix produced when we substitute the values of our data into the basis functions is called the design matrix . Linear/Polynomial Regression We will use the diabetes dataset. Variables are: subject: subject ID number age: age diagnosed with diabetes acidity: a measure of acidity called base deficit Response: y: natural log of serum C-peptide concentration Original source is Sockett et al. (1987) mentioned in Hastie and Tibshirani's book \"Generalized Additive Models\". Reading the data in Pandas: In [10]: diab = pd . read_csv ( \"data/diabetes.csv\" ) diab . head () Create the design matrix for a fictitious dataset Let's keep just the age feature and create some columns of our own. Let's see how good this matrix is before we create the design matrix. In [11]: diab_age = diab [[ 'age' ]] . copy () diab_age [ 'age2' ] = diab_age . apply ( lambda row : row [ 'age' ] ** 2 , axis = 1 ) diab_age [ 'random' ] = np . random . normal ( 0 , 1 , len ( diab_age )) diab_age [ 'same' ] = diab_age [ 'age' ] diab_age . head () In [12]: A = diab_age . to_numpy ( copy = True ) A [: 5 ] Let's check if the columns of A are linearly independent by using some linear algebra methods from numpy.linalg and sympy .

T . rref () inds In [163]: np . linalg . cond ( A ) Create the design matrix for age using a polynomial basis Let's keep just the age feature again and create the design matrix using a polynomial of degree n .

As you remember from 109a, we have two tools for Linear Regression: statsmodels https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/regression.html , and sklearn https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html Previously, in this notebook, we worked from a vector of target values and a design matrix we built ourself. In 109a we used e.g. sklearn 's PolynomialFeatures to build the matrix. Now we will look at statsmodels which allows users to fit statistical models using R-style formulas . They build the target value and design matrix for you. Note: Categorical features (e.g. let's say we had a categorical feature called Region, are designated by C(Region) ), polynomial features (e.g. age) are entered as np.power(age, n) where n is the degree of the polynomial OR np.vander(age, n, increasing=True) . # Example: if our target variable is 'Lottery', while 'Region' is a categorical predictor and all the others are numerical: df = dta.data[['Lottery', 'Literacy', 'Wealth', 'Region']] formula='Lottery ~ Literacy + Wealth + C(Region) + Literacy * Wealth' For more on these formulas see: https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/examples/notebooks/generated/formulas.html https://patsy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html In [191]: import statsmodels.formula.api as smf model1 = smf . ols ( 'y ~ age' , data = diab ) fit1_lm = model1 . fit () Let's build a dataframe to predict values on (sometimes this is just the test or validation set). Very useful for making pretty plots of the model predictions - predict for TONS of values, not just whatever's in the training set. In [194]: x_pred = np . linspace ( 0.5 , 20 , 100 ) predict_df = pd . DataFrame ( data = { \"age\" : x_pred }) predict_df . head () Use get_prediction( ).summary_frame() to get the model's prediction (and error bars!) In [195]: prediction_output = fit1_lm . get_prediction ( predict_df ) . summary_frame () prediction_output . head () Plot the data, the fitted model, the confidence intervals , and the prediction intervals . For more on how statsmodels calculates these intervals see: https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/_modules/statsmodels/regression/_prediction.html In [196]: ax1 = diab . plot . scatter ( x = 'age' , y = 'y' , c = 'brown' , title = \"Diabetes data with least-squares linear fit\" ) ax1 . set_xlabel ( \"Age at Diagnosis\" ) ax1 . set_ylabel ( \"Log C-Peptide Concentration\" ) ax1 . plot ( predict_df . age , prediction_output [ 'mean' ], color = \"green\" ) ax1 . plot ( predict_df . age , prediction_output [ 'mean_ci_lower' ], color = \"blue\" , linestyle = \"dashed\" ) ax1 . plot ( predict_df . age , prediction_output [ 'mean_ci_upper' ], color = \"blue\" , linestyle = \"dashed\" ) ax1 . plot ( predict_df . age , prediction_output [ 'obs_ci_lower' ], color = \"green\" , linestyle = \"dashdot\" ) ax1 . plot ( predict_df . age , prediction_output [ 'obs_ci_upper' ], color = \"green\" , linestyle = \"dashdot\" ); Breakout Room Exercise Fit a 3rd degree polynomial model to predict y using only age and Plot the model and its confidence intervals. Change the degree of your polynomial and see what happens to the fitted curve. Does our model have an intercept?

An alternative technique involves QR decomposition (details in any good linear algebra book). statsmodels lets you use this technique via a parameter in the .fit : .fit(method='qr') Let's try with QR now In [210]: formula = \"y ~ np.vander(age, 6, increasing=True) -1\" fit3_lm = smf . ols ( formula = formula , data = diab ) . fit ( method = 'qr' ) In [211]: fit3_lm . params In [212]: # solution poly_predictions = fit3_lm . get_prediction ( predict_df ) . summary_frame () poly_predictions . head () In [213]: # solution ax2 = diab . plot . scatter ( x = 'age' , y = 'y' , c = 'Red' , title = \"Diabetes data with least-squares cubic fit\" ) ax2 . set_xlabel ( \"Age at Diagnosis\" ) ax2 . set_ylabel ( \"Log C-Peptide Concentration\" ) ax2 . plot ( predict_df . age , poly_predictions [ 'mean' ], color = \"green\" ) ax2 . plot ( predict_df . age , poly_predictions [ 'mean_ci_lower' ], color = \"blue\" , linestyle = \"dashed\" , label = 'confidence interval' ) ax2 . plot ( predict_df . age , poly_predictions [ 'mean_ci_upper' ], color = \"blue\" , linestyle = \"dashed\" ); ax2 . legend ();",

Understand how to implement various functions in statsmodels , e.g. how to use R-like formulas for variable representation. 1. Getting class material Option 1A: Download directly from Ed Use the >> to download. Option 1B: Cloning the class repo and then copying the contents in a different directory so you can make changes. You may access the code used in class by cloning the class repo: https://github.com/Harvard-IACS/2021-CS109B Open the Terminal in your computer and go to the Directory where you want to clone the repo. Then run git clone https://github.com/Harvard-IACS/2021-CS109B.git If you have already cloned the repo, OR if new material is added (happens every day), go inside the '/2021-CS109B/' directory and run git pull Caution: If you change the notebooks and then run git pull your changes will be overwritten. So create a playground folder and copy the folder with the notebook with which you want to work. Option 1C: (use at own risk) Forking the class repo In order not to lose any changes you have made when updating the content (pulling) from the main repo, a good practice is to fork the repo locally. For more on this see Maddy Nakada's notes (make sure you substitute 2019 for 2021!): How to Fork a Repo . NOTE: While Fork is a proper way to handle local changes, it doesn't magically solve everything -- if you edit a file that originated from our course repo (e.g., a HW notebook), and later pull from our 'upstream' repo again, any changes you make will require resolving merge conflict(s) . Thus, if you want to safetly and easily preserve any of your changes, we recommend renaming your files and/or copying them into an independent directory within your repo. 2. Running code: Option 2A: Using your local environment Use Virtual Environments: we cannot stress this enough! Isolating your projects inside specific environments helps you manage dependencies and therefore keep your sanity. You can recover from mess-ups by simply deleting an environment. Sometimes certain installation of libraries conflict with one another. The two most popular tools for setting up environments are: conda (a package and environment manager) pip (a Python package manager) with virtualenv (a tool for creating environments) We recommend using conda package installation and environments. conda installs packages from the Anaconda Repository and Anaconda Cloud, whereas pip installs packages from PyPI. Even if you are using conda as your primary package installer and are inside a conda environment, you can still use pip install for those rare packages that are not included in the conda ecosystem. See here for more details on how to manage Conda Environments . Use the cs109b.yml file to create an environment: $ conda env create -f cs109b.yml $ conda activate cs109b We have included the packages that you will need in the cs109b.yml file. Option 2B: Using Cloud Resources Using FAS OnDemand (supported by CS109b) FAS provides a platform, accessible via the FAS OnDemand menu link in Canvas . Most of the libraries such as keras, tensorflow, pandas, etc., are pre-installed. If a library is missing you may install it via the Terminal. NOTE : The AWS platform is funded by FAS for the purposes of the class. You are not allowed to use it for purposes not related to this course. Make sure you stop your instance as soon as you do not need it. Information on how to use the platform is displayed when you click the link. For more see Fas OnDemand Guide . Using Google Colab (on your own) Google's Colab platform https://colab.research.google.com/ offers a GPU enviromnent to test your ideas, it's fast, free, with the only caveat that your files persist only for 12 hours (last time we checked). The solution is to keep your files in a repository and just clone it each time you use Colab. Using AWS in the Cloud (on your own) For those of you who want to have your own machines in the Cloud to run whatever you want, Amazon Web Services is a (paid) solution. For more see: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/setting-up.html Remember, AWS is a paid service, so if you let your machine run for days you will get charged! 3.

Plotting matplotlib and seaborn matplotlib seaborn: statistical data visualization . seaborn works great with pandas . It can also be customized easily. Here is the basic seaborn tutorial: Seaborn tutorial . Plotting a function of 2 variables using contours In optimization, our objective function will often be a function of two or more variables. While it's hard to visualize a function of more than 3 variables, it's very informative to plot one of 2 variables. To do this we use contours. First we define the $x1$ and $x2$ variables and then construct their pairs using meshgrid . In [9]: import seaborn as sn In [10]: x1 = np . linspace ( - 0.1 , 0.1 , 50 ) x2 = np . linspace ( - 0.1 , 0.1 , 100 ) xx , yy = np . meshgrid ( x1 , x2 ) z = np . sqrt ( xx ** 2 + yy ** 2 ) plt . contour ( x1 , x2 , z ); 5. We will be using keras via tensorflow TensorFlow is a framework for representing complicated ML algorithms and executing them in any platform, from a phone to a distributed system using GPUs. Developed by Google Brain, TensorFlow is used very broadly today. Keras , is a high-level API, created by François Chollet, and used for fast prototyping, advanced research, and production. tf.keras is now maintained by Tensorflow.

We'll also be using statsmodels' powerful formula interface. It lets one write complex models succinctly and without building complex design matrices by hand. Below, we write 'y~age' to mean \"the y column is approximately $\\beta_1$ times the age column (plus a constant $\\beta_0$\". We could include more columns, or transformations of the age column, e.g. ' y ~ age + age**2 + acidity' . In [4]: fit1_lm = sm . ols ( 'y~age' , data = diab ) . fit () We create a very dense set of values to predict on. Remember: the point of a model is to provide outputs for a wide variety of inputs. No need to only predict on the training or test values-- the model can predict on anything you ask it to! Further, it's important when working with statsmodels that we make a named data frame - if we only use a numpy array statsmodels won't know it's the 'age' variable. In [5]: xpred = pd . DataFrame ({ \"age\" : np . arange ( 0 , 16.1 , 0.1 )}) Plot the prediction line and confidence intervals In [6]: pred1 = fit1_lm . predict ( xpred ) prediction_output = fit1_lm . get_prediction ( xpred ) . summary_frame () prediction_output . head () Out[6]: mean mean_se mean_ci_lower mean_ci_upper obs_ci_lower obs_ci_upper 0 3.996031 0.244590 3.502071 4.489991 2.600828 5.391235 1 4.004340 0.242324 3.514957 4.493723 2.610750 5.397929 2 4.012648 0.240062 3.527834 4.497463 2.620656 5.404640 3 4.020957 0.237804 3.540703 4.501211 2.630547 5.411367 4 4.029266 0.235550 3.553562 4.504969 2.640421 5.418111 Above, we use fitted_model.get_prediction().summary_frame() to get predictions and confidence intervals. In [7]: ax1 = diab . plot . scatter ( x = 'age' , y = 'y' , c = 'Red' , title = \"Diabetes data with least-squares linear fit\" ) ax1 . set_xlabel ( \"Age at Diagnosis\" ) ax1 . set_ylabel ( \"Log C-Peptide Concentration\" ) ax1 . plot ( xpred . age , prediction_output [ 'mean' ], color = \"green\" ) # CI for the predection at each x value, i.e. the line itself ax1 . plot ( xpred . age , prediction_output [ 'mean_ci_lower' ], color = \"blue\" , linestyle = \"dashed\" ) ax1 . plot ( xpred . age , prediction_output [ 'mean_ci_upper' ], color = \"blue\" , linestyle = \"dashed\" ); # CIs for where future data will fall #ax1.plot(xpred.age, prediction_output['obs_ci_lower'], color=\"skyblue\",linestyle=\"dashed\") #ax1.plot(xpred.age, prediction_output['obs_ci_upper'], color=\"skyblue\",linestyle=\"dashed\"); Polynomial Regression In sklearn we would use polynomial_features. Here we use vander to build the matrix of transformed inputs. In particular, vander is a numpy function and therefore usable directly in the formula- it saves us from writing out y ~ age + age**2 + age**3 + ... and so on. vander is for Vandermonde. It's a matrix where the first column is $x&#94;0$, the second is $x&#94;1$, the third is $x&#94;2$ and so on. np.vander([6,3,5], 4, increasing=True) = array([[ 1, 6, 36, 216], [ 1, 3, 9, 27], [ 1, 5, 25, 125]]) Since we have a constant column in the matrix, we put a -1 in the formula to drop the additional constant term statsmodels would otherwise insert Note that this is not an orthogonal polynomial basis. Our estimated coefficients will be more sensitive to the data than they need to be. In [8]: # *cubic* polynomial (vander's input is one more than the degree) fit2_lm = sm . ols ( formula = \"y ~ np.vander(age, 4, increasing=True) -1\" , data = diab ) . fit () # the same model written out explicitly fit2_lm_long = sm . ols ( formula = \"y ~ age + np.power(age, 2) + np.power(age, 3)\" , data = diab ) . fit () poly_predictions = fit2_lm . get_prediction ( xpred ) . summary_frame () poly_predictions Out[8]: mean mean_se mean_ci_lower mean_ci_upper obs_ci_lower obs_ci_upper 0 2.740481 0.508197 1.712556 3.768406 1.156238 4.324724 1 2.806326 0.486091 1.823115 3.789538 1.250724 4.361929 2 2.870902 0.464764 1.930827 3.810977 1.342198 4.399606 3 2.934219 0.444219 2.035702 3.832737 1.430714 4.437725 4 2.996291 0.424456 2.137747 3.854835 1.516327 4.476255 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 156 5.020575 0.362481 4.287387 5.753763 3.609632 6.431518 157 5.031705 0.379499 4.264095 5.799315 3.602572 6.460837 158 5.043414 0.397195 4.240011 5.846817 3.594742 6.492087 159 5.055716 0.415572 4.215142 5.896290 3.586104 6.525328 160 5.068621 0.434633 4.189494 5.947749 3.576622 6.560620 161 rows × 6 columns In [9]: ax2 = diab . plot . scatter ( x = 'age' , y = 'y' , c = 'Red' , title = \"Diabetes data with least-squares cubic fit\" ) ax2 . set_xlabel ( \"Age at Diagnosis\" ) ax2 . set_ylabel ( \"Log C-Peptide Concentration\" ) # CI for the predection at each x value, i.e. the curve itself ax2 . plot ( xpred . age , poly_predictions [ 'mean' ], color = \"green\" ) ax2 . plot ( xpred . age , poly_predictions [ 'mean_ci_lower' ], color = \"blue\" , linestyle = \"dashed\" ) ax2 . plot ( xpred . age , poly_predictions [ 'mean_ci_upper' ], color = \"blue\" , linestyle = \"dashed\" ); # CIs for where future data will fall #ax2.plot(xpred.age, poly_predictions['obs_ci_lower'], color=\"skyblue\",linestyle=\"dashed\") #ax2.plot(xpred.age, poly_predictions['obs_ci_upper'], color=\"skyblue\",linestyle=\"dashed\"); Logistic Regression Statsmodels provides logistic regression via the same formula-based interface. For the sake of doing logistic regression, suppose we have the binary outcome \"Was y above 4?\" In [10]: diab [ 'y_bin' ] = 1 * ( diab [ 'y' ] > 4 ) # multiply by 1 because statsmodels wants 1s and 0s instead of true and false In [11]: logit_model = sm . logit ( \"y_bin ~ age\" , data = diab ) . fit () logit_prediction = logit_model . predict ( xpred ) Optimization terminated successfully.

It takes a fraction of the data that should be used in smoothing each point. Please note that you are not responsible for mastering lowess - this is merely for your edification. In [16]: from statsmodels.nonparametric.smoothers_lowess import lowess as lowess lowess_models = {} for cur_frac in [ . 15 , . 25 , . 7 , 1 ]: lowess_models [ cur_frac ] = lowess ( diab [ 'y' ], diab [ 'age' ], frac = cur_frac ) Note Python's lowess implementation does not have any tool to predict on new data; it only returns the fitted function's value at the training points. We're making up for that by drawing a straight line between consecutive fitted values (scipy's interp1d ). (There are other more sophisticated interpolation techniques, but the ideal approach would be to predict on new points using lowess itself. This is a limitation of the Python implementation, not lowess itself. R, for example, has a much fuller Lowess toolkit) In [17]: from scipy.interpolate import interp1d for cur_frac , cur_model in lowess_models . items (): ax = diab . plot . scatter ( x = 'age' , y = 'y' , c = 'Red' , title = \"Lowess Fit, Fraction = {} \" . format ( cur_frac )) ax . set_xlabel ( \"Age at Diagnosis\" ) ax . set_ylabel ( \"Log C-Peptide Concentration\" ) lowess_interpolation = interp1d ( cur_model [:, 0 ], cur_model [:, 1 ], bounds_error = False ) ax . plot ( xpred , lowess_interpolation ( xpred ), color = \"Blue\" ) plt . show () As the fraction of data increases, Lowess moves from high-variance to high-bias In [18]: ax = diab . plot . scatter ( x = 'age' , y = 'y' , c = 'Red' , title = \"Large variance, low bias smoother\" ) ax . set_xlabel ( \"Age at Diagnosis\" ) ax . set_ylabel ( \"Log C-Peptide Concentration\" ) lowess_interpolation = interp1d ( lowess_models [ . 15 ][:, 0 ], lowess_models [ . 15 ][:, 1 ], bounds_error = False ) ax . plot ( xpred , lowess_interpolation ( xpred ), color = \"lightgreen\" ) plt . show () ax = diab . plot . scatter ( x = 'age' , y = 'y' , c = 'Red' , title = \"Low variance, large bias smoother\" ) ax . set_xlabel ( \"Age at Diagnosis\" ) ax . set_ylabel ( \"Log C-Peptide Concentration\" ) lowess_interpolation = interp1d ( lowess_models [ 1 ][:, 0 ], lowess_models [ 1 ][:, 1 ], bounds_error = False ) ax . plot ( xpred , lowess_interpolation ( xpred ), color = \"lightgreen\" ) plt . show () Splines (via knots) Here, we flash back to OLS and logistic regression. So far, we've made \"design\" matrices by taking powers of the raw data's columns and asking the solver \"how much of each transformed column is there\"? That's fine if there's an a-priori theoretical reason to think the relationship truly is polynomial. But in most cases we can use much richer and better transformations of the raw data The function below is one such better transformation of the raw data. It (depending on the parameters) applies a RELU or truncated cubic to the input data. Let's see what that looks like In [19]: def h ( x , knot , exponent ): output = np . power ( x - knot , exponent ) output [ x <= knot ] = 0 return output Transforming the x values [0,10] with a knot at 4, power 1. Everything below 4 is zeroed out, values above 4 increase at slope 1.

The resulting solution is a cubic spline with knots at every data value that is regularized according to a smoothing parameter. We use the csaps library to implement smoothing splines. The smoothing parameter takes on values between 0 and 1, and is the weight attached to the error sum of squares of the weighted average between the error sum of squares and the wiggliness penalty. A smoothing parameter of 0 correspondends to a least-squares fit, and a parameter of 1 corresponds to connecting-the-dots.

The most pathetic scenes were those when the Columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared phony, and her pseudo-love affair with Walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning.

But unfortunately, computers can read! 📖--🤖❓ Preprocessing Text Data Computers have no built-in knowledge of language and cannot understand text data in any rich way that humans do -- at least not without some help! The first crucial step in natural language processing is to clean and preprocess your data so that your algorithms and models can make use of it. We'll look at a few preprocess steps: - tokenization - padding - numerical encoding Depending on your NLP task, you may want to take additional preprocessing steps which we will not cover here. These can include: converting all characters to lowercase treating each punctuation mark as a token (e.g., , . ! ? are each separate tokens) removing punctuation altogether separating each sentence with a unique symbol (e.g., and ) removing words that are incredibly common (e.g., function words, (in)definite articles). These are referred to as 'stopwords'). Lemmatizing (replacing words with their 'dictionary entry form') Stemming (removing grammatical morphemes) Useful NLP Python libraries such as NLTK and spaCy provide built in methods for many of these preprocessing steps. Tokenization Tokens are the atomic units of meaning which our model will be working with. What should these units be? These could be characters, words, or even sentences. For our movie review classifier we will be working at the word level. For this example we will process just a subset of the original dataset. In [8]: SAMPLE_SIZE = 10 subset = list ( train . take ( SAMPLE_SIZE )) subset [ 0 ] Out[8]: {'label': , 'text': } The TFDS format allows for the construction of efficient preprocessing pipelines. But for our own preprocessing example we will be primarily working with Python list objects. This gives us a chance to practice the Python list comprehension which is a powerful tool to have at your disposal. It will serve you well when processing arbitrary text which may not already be in a nice TFDS format (such as in the HW 😉). We'll convert our data subset into X and y lists. In [9]: X = [ x [ 'text' ] . numpy () . decode () for x in subset ] y = [ x [ 'label' ] . numpy () for x in subset ] In [10]: print ( f 'X has { len ( X ) } reviews' ) print ( f 'y has { len ( y ) } labels' ) X has 10 reviews y has 10 labels In [11]: N_CHARS = 20 print ( f 'First { N_CHARS } characters of all reviews: \\n { [ x [: 20 ] + \"...\" for x in X ] } \\n ' ) print ( f 'All labels: \\n { y } ' ) First 20 characters of all reviews: ['This was an absolute...', 'I have been known to...', 'Mann photographs the...', 'This is the kind of ...', 'As others have menti...', 'This is a film which...', 'Okay, you have: Each observation in X is a review. A review is a str object which we can think of as a sequence of characters. This is indeed how Python treats strings as made clear by how we are printing 'slices' of each review in the code cell above. We'll see a bit later that you can in fact sucessfully train a neural network on text data at the character level. But for the moment we will work at the word level, treating the word level. This means our observations should be organized as sequences of words rather than sequences of characters. In [12]: # list comprehensions again to the rescue! X = [ x . split () for x in X ] # The same thing can be accomplished with: # list(map(str.split, X)) # but that is much harder to parse! O_o Now let's look at the first 10 tokens in the first 2 reviews. In [13]: X [ 0 ][: 10 ], X [ 1 ][: 10 ] Out[13]: (['This', 'was', 'an', 'absolutely', 'terrible', 'movie.', \"Don't\", 'be', 'lured', 'in'], ['I', 'have', 'been', 'known', 'to', 'fall', 'asleep', 'during', 'films,', 'but']) Padding Let's take a look at the lengths of the reviews in our subset. In [14]: [ len ( x ) for x in X ] Out[14]: [116, 112, 132, 88, 81, 289, 557, 111, 223, 127] If we were training our RNN one sentence at a time, it would be okay to have sentences of varying lengths. However, as with any neural network, it can be sometimes be advantageous to train inputs in batches. When doing so with RNNs, our input tensors need to be of the same length/dimensions. Here are two examples of tokenized reviews padded to have a length of 5. ['I', 'loved', 'it', ' ', ' '] ['It', 'stinks', ' ', ' ', ' '] Now let's pad our own examples. Note that 'padding' in this context also means truncating sequences that are longer than our specified max length. In [15]: MAX_LEN = 500 PAD = ' ' # truncate X = [ x [: MAX_LEN ] for x in X ] # pad for x in X : while len ( x ) < MAX_LEN : x . append ( PAD ) In [16]: [ len ( x ) for x in X ] Out[16]: [500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500] Now all reviews are of a uniform length! Numerical Encoding If each review in our dataset is an observation, then the features of each observation are the tokens, in this case, words. But these words are still strings. Our machine learning methods require us to be able to multiple our features by weights. If we want to use these words as inputs for a neural network we'll have to convert them into some numerical representation. One solution is to create a one-to-one mapping between unique words and integers. If the five sentences below were our entire corpus, our conversion would look this: i have books - [1, 4, 2] interesting books are useful [11,2,9,8] i have computers [1,4,3] computers are interesting and useful [3,5,11,10,8] books and computers are both valuable. [2,10,3,9,13,12] bye bye [7,7] I-1, books-2, computers-3, have-4, are-5, computers-6,bye-7, useful-8, are-9, and-10,interesting-11, valuable-12, both-13 To accomplish this we'll first need to know what all the unique words are in our dataset. In [17]: all_tokens = [ word for review in X for word in review ] In [18]: # sanity check len ( all_tokens ), sum ([ len ( x ) for x in X ]) Out[18]: (5000, 5000) Casting our list of words into a set is a great way to get all the unique words in the data. In [19]: vocab = sorted ( set ( all_tokens )) print ( 'Unique Words:' , len ( vocab )) Unique Words: 892 Now we need to create a mapping from words to integers.

In [25]: X_proc = np . hstack ( X_proc ) . reshape ( - 1 , MAX_LEN ) y = np . array ( y ) X_proc , y Out[25]: (array([[211, 851, 272, ..., 69, 69, 69], [131, 495, 308, ..., 69, 69, 69], [160, 649, 799, ..., 69, 69, 69], ..., [206, 445, 525, ..., 69, 69, 69], [131, 687, 552, ..., 69, 69, 69], [201, 810, 622, ..., 69, 69, 69]]), array([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0])) Now, just to prove that we've successfully processed the data, we perform a test train split and feed it into a FNN.

But our subset was very small so we shouldn't get excited about the results above. The IMDB dataset is very popular so keras also includes an alternative method for loading the data.

In [35]: plt . hist ([ len ( x ) for x in X_train ]) plt . title ( 'review lengths' ); We saw one way of doing this earlier, but Keras actually has a built in pad_sequences helper function.

How could we improve our tokenization? Model 2: Feed-Forward Network /w Embeddings One can view the embedding process as a linear projection from one vector space to another. For NLP, we usually use embeddings to project the sparse one-hot encodings of words on to a lower-dimensional continuous space so that the input surface is 'dense' and possibly smooth. Thus, one can view this embedding layer process as just a transformation from $\\mathbb{R}&#94;{inp}$ to $\\mathbb{R}&#94;{emb}$ This not only reduces dimensionality but also allows semantic similarities between tokens to be captured by 'similiarities' between the embedding vectors. This was not possible with one-hot encoding as all vectors there were orthogonal to one another. It is also possible to load pretrained embeddings that were learned from giant corpora. This would be an instance of transfer learning. If you are interested in learning more, start with the astromonically impactful papers of word2vec and GloVe . In Keras we use the Embedding layer: tf.keras.layers.Embedding( input_dim, output_dim, embeddings_initializer='uniform', embeddings_regularizer=None, activity_regularizer=None, embeddings_constraint=None, mask_zero=False, input_length=None, **kwargs ) We'll need to specify the input_dim and output_dim . If working with sequences, as we are, you'll also need to set the input_length .

More information on convolutions on text data can be found on this blog . If you want to learn more, read this published and well-cited paper from Eleni's friend, Byron Wallace. Q : Why do we use Conv1D if our input, a sequence of word embeddings, is 2D?

The input layer is fully connected to the hidden layer, and the hidden layer is fully connected to the output layer. However, the crux of what makes it a recurrent neural network is that the hidden layer for a given time t is not only based on the input layer at time t but also the hidden layer from time t-1 . Here's a popular blog post on The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks . In Keras, the vanilla RNN unit is implemented the SimpleRNN layer: tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN( units, activation='tanh', use_bias=True, kernel_initializer='glorot_uniform', recurrent_initializer='orthogonal', bias_initializer='zeros', kernel_regularizer=None, recurrent_regularizer=None, bias_regularizer=None, activity_regularizer=None, kernel_constraint=None, recurrent_constraint=None, bias_constraint=None, dropout=0.0, recurrent_dropout=0.0, return_sequences=False, return_state=False, go_backwards=False, stateful=False, unroll=False, **kwargs ) As you can see, recurrent layers in Keras take many arguments. We only need to be concerned with units , which specifies the size of the hidden state, and return_sequences , which will be discussed shortly. For the moment is it fine to leave this set to the default of False . Due to the limitations of the vanilla RNN unit (more on that next) it tends not to be used much in practice. For this reason it seems that the Keras developers neglected to implement GPU acceleration for this layer! Notice how much slower the trainig is even for a network with far fewer parameters. In [45]: model = Sequential ( name = 'SimpleRNN' ) model . add ( Embedding ( MAX_VOCAB , EMBED_DIM , input_length = MAX_LEN )) model . add ( SimpleRNN ( 100 )) model . add ( Dense ( 1 , activation = 'sigmoid' )) model . compile ( loss = 'binary_crossentropy' , optimizer = 'adam' , metrics = [ 'accuracy' ]) print ( model . summary ()) model . fit ( X_train , y_train , epochs = 3 , batch_size = 128 ) scores = model . evaluate ( X_test , y_test , verbose = 0 ) print ( \"Accuracy: %.2f%% \" % ( scores [ 1 ] * 100 )) Model: \"SimpleRNN\" _________________________________________________________________ Layer (type) Output Shape Param # ================================================================= embedding_3 (Embedding) (None, 500, 100) 1000000 _________________________________________________________________ simple_rnn (SimpleRNN) (None, 100) 20100 _________________________________________________________________ dense_10 (Dense) (None, 1) 101 ================================================================= Total params: 1,020,201 Trainable params: 1,020,201 Non-trainable params: 0 _________________________________________________________________ None Epoch 1/3 196/196 [==============================] - 53s 267ms/step - loss: 0.6720 - accuracy: 0.5660 Epoch 2/3 196/196 [==============================] - 52s 266ms/step - loss: 0.5283 - accuracy: 0.7444 Epoch 3/3 196/196 [==============================] - 52s 265ms/step - loss: 0.3406 - accuracy: 0.8588 Accuracy: 83.13% Vanishing/Exploding Gradients We need to backpropogate through every time step to calculate the gradients used for our weight updates. This requires the use of the chain rule which amounts to repeated multiplications. This can cause two types of problems. First, this product can quickly 'explode,' becoming large, causing destructive updates to the model and numerical overflow. One hack to solve this problem is to clip the gradient at some threshold. Alternatively, the gradient can 'vanish,' getting smaller and smaller as the gradient moves backwards in time. Gradient clipping will not help us here. If we can't propogate gradients suffuciently far back in time then our network will be unable to learn long temporal dependencies. This problem motivates the architecture of the GRU and LSTM units as substitutes for the 'vanilla' RNN. For a more detailed look at the vanishing/exploding gradient problem, please see Marios's excellent Advanced Section . Model 5: GRU $X_{t}$: input $U$, $V$, and $\\beta$: parameter matrices and vector $\\tilde{h_t}$: candidate activation vector $h_{t}$: output vector $R_t$: reset gate $Z_t$: update gate The gates of the GRU allow for the gradients to flow more freely to previous time steps, helping to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. In Keras, the GRU layer is used in exactly the same way as the SimpleRNN layer. tf.keras.layers.GRU( units, activation='tanh', recurrent_activation='sigmoid', use_bias=True, kernel_initializer='glorot_uniform', recurrent_initializer='orthogonal', bias_initializer='zeros', kernel_regularizer=None, recurrent_regularizer=None, bias_regularizer=None, activity_regularizer=None, kernel_constraint=None, recurrent_constraint=None, bias_constraint=None, dropout=0.0, recurrent_dropout=0.0, return_sequences=False, return_state=False, go_backwards=False, stateful=False, unroll=False, time_major=False, reset_after=True, **kwargs ) Here we just swap it in to the previous architecture. Note how much faster it trains with GPU excelleration than the simple RNN!

A BiDirectional RNN consists of two separate recurrent units. One processing the sequence from left to right, the other processes that same sequence but in reverse, from right to left. The output of the two units are then merged together (typically concatenated) and feed to the next layer of the network. Creating a Bidirection RNN in Keras is quite simple. We just 'wrap' a recurrent layer in the Bidirectional layer. The default behavior is to concatenate the output from each direction. tf.keras.layers.Bidirectional( layer, merge_mode='concat', weights=None, backward_layer=None, **kwargs ) Example: model = Sequential() ... model.add(Bidirectional(SimpleRNN(n_nodes)) ... Deep RNNs We may want to stack RNN layers one after another. But there is a problem. A recurrent layer expects to be given a sequence as input, and yet we can see that the recurrent layer in each of our models above outputs a single vector. This is because the default behavior of Keras's recurrent layers is to suppress the output until the final time step. If we want to have two recurrent units in a row then the first will have to given an output after each time step, thus providing a sequence to the 2nd recurrent layer. We can have our recurrent layers output at each time step setting return_sequences=True . Example: model = Sequential() ... model.add(LSTM(100, return_sequences=True)) model.add(LSTM(100) ... TimeDistributed Layer TimeDistributed is a 'wrapper' that applies a layer to all time steps of an input sequence. tf.keras.layers.TimeDistributed( layer, **kwargs ) We use TimeDistributed when we want to input a sequence into a layer that doesn't normally expect a time dimension, such as Dense . In [146]: model = Sequential () model . add ( TimeDistributed ( Dense ( 8 ), input_shape = ( 3 , 5 ))) input_array = np . random . randint ( 10 , size = ( 1 , 3 , 5 )) print ( \"Shape of input : \" , input_array . shape ) model . compile ( 'rmsprop' , 'mse' ) output_array = model . predict ( input_array ) print ( \"Shape of output : \" , output_array . shape ) Shape of input : (1, 3, 5) Shape of output : (1, 3, 8) RepeatVector Layer RepeatVector repeats the vector a specified number of times. Dimension changes from (batch_size, number_of_elements) to (batch_size, number_of_repetitions, number_of_elements) This effectively generates a sequence from a single input. In [88]: model = Sequential () model . add ( Dense ( 2 , input_dim = 1 )) model . add ( RepeatVector ( 3 )) model . summary () Model: \"sequential_9\" _________________________________________________________________ Layer (type) Output Shape Param # ================================================================= dense_37 (Dense) (None, 2) 4 _________________________________________________________________ repeat_vector_5 (RepeatVecto (None, 3, 2) 0 ================================================================= Total params: 4 Trainable params: 4 Non-trainable params: 0 _________________________________________________________________ Model 7: CNN + RNN CNNs are good at learning spatial features, and sentences can be thought of as 1-D spatial vectors (dimensionality is determined by the number of words in the sentence). We can then take the features learned by the CNN (after a maxpooling layer) and feed them into an RNN! We expect the CNN to be able to pick out invariant features across the 1-D spatial structure (i.e., sentence) that characterize good and bad sentiment. This learned spatial features may then be learned as sequences by a reccurent layer. The classification step is then performed by a final dense layer. Exercise: Build a CNN + Deep, BiDirectional GRU Model Let's put together everything we've learned so far.

Arithmetic with an RNN Thanks go to Eleni for this code example. In this exercise, we are going to teach addition to our model. Given two numbers (<999), the model outputs their sum (<9999). The input is provided as a string '231+432' and the model will provide its output as ' 663' (Here the empty space is the padding character). We are not going to use any external dataset and are going to construct our own dataset for this exercise. The exercise we attempt to do effectively \"translates\" a sequence of characters '231+432' to another sequence of characters ' 663' and hence, this class of models are called sequence-to-sequence models (aka seq2seq). Such architectures have profound applications in several real-life tasks such as machine translation, summarization, image captioning etc. To be clear, sequence-to-sequence (aka seq2seq) models take as input a sequence of length N and return a sequence of length M, where N and M may or may not differ, and every single observation/input may be of different values, too. For example, machine translation concerns converting text from one natural language to another (e.g., translating English to French). Google Translate is an example, and their system is a seq2seq model. The input (e.g., an English sentence) can be of any length, and the output (e.g., a French sentence) may be of any length. Background knowledge: The earliest and most simple seq2seq model works by having one RNN for the input, just like we've always done, and we refer to it as being an \"encoder.\" The final hidden state of the encoder RNN is fed as input to another RNN that we refer to as the \"decoder.\" The job of the decoder is to generate each token, one word at a time. This may seem really limiting, as it relies on the encoder encapsulating the entire input sequence with just 1 hidden layer. It seems unrealistic that we could encode an entire meaning of a sentence with just one hidden layer. Yet, results even in this simplistic manner can be quite impressive. In fact, these early results were compelling enough that these models immediately replaced the decades of earlier machine translation work.

This means that at the end of the step the next component will only get to see the final hidden layer's values. On the other hand, if you set return_sequences = True , the LSTM component will return the hidden layer at each time step. It means that the next component should be able to consume inputs in that form.

Possible Experimentation Try changing the hyperparams, use other RNNs, more layers, check if increasing the number of epochs is useful. Try reversing the data from validation set and check if commutative property of addition is learned by the model. Try printing the hidden layer with two inputs that are commutative and check if the hidden representations it learned are same or similar. Do we expect it to be true? If so, why? If not why? You can access the layer using an index with model.layers and layer.output will give the output of that layer. Try doing addition in the RNN model the same way we do by hand. Reverse the order of digits and at each time step, input two digits get an output use the hidden layer and input next two digits and so on.(units in the first time step, tens in the second time step etc.)",
